docs(skills): the `objectstack-api` skill stops teaching an app to mount routes on `http.server` — an app declares `apis:`, computes in a flow, and registers code as a stack function or a connector (#23787)

Clause-②: no

`skills/objectstack-api/SKILL.md`'s decision table sent an endpoint that needs code to an imperative `http.server` mount on `kernel:ready`, and its "Code routes" section taught that mount. Ruling C′ item 2 on #23128 retired the mount as an app-author surface: the `http.server` service is the platform plugins' own door-building primitive. The table now points code at a `type: 'flow'` endpoint whose `script` node runs a stack function (`defineStack({ functions })`) or whose `connector_action` node calls a declared connector, names the inbound `type: 'api'` flow hook for a webhook signed with ObjectStack's own `x-objectstack-signature`, and states the three cases that have no app surface today (a third-party callback verified by its own signature over the raw body, a streaming response, a protocol the platform does not speak) instead of inventing one. The "Code routes" section is deleted, and eval 3 expects that answer. Skill text only; nothing an author writes changes.
