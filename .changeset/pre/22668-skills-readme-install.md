docs(skills): both READMEs the package ships install the catalog from `@objectstack/skills` at the installed `@objectstack/spec`'s version, and name the GitHub path only as the `next` channel (#22668)

Clause-②: no

`README.md` (the npm page) and `dist/skills/README.md` (the catalog's front page, copied from the repository's `skills/README.md`) are the two READMEs this package ships. Both now give the same two-step install the docs give: `npm install --save-dev "@objectstack/skills@$(node -p "require('@objectstack/spec/package.json').version")"`, then `npx skills experimental_sync --agent claude-code -y` — the catalog's version is then the installed spec's.

Before: the npm page taught a bare `npm install --save-dev @objectstack/skills`, which on a project depending on `@objectstack/spec` 17.x installs `18.0.0-next.0`, the next major's catalog (the registry's `latest`); its example named `@objectstack/skills@17.7.0`, a version that was never published; and it did not say that the sync skips every skill a `skills add` installed, which is every project `create-objectstack` scaffolded through `18.0.0-next.0`. The catalog's front page still taught `npx skills add objectstack-ai/objectstack/skills …` as the install command for existing projects.

Both pages now state which versions exist (published from `18.0.0-next.0` on; no 17.x, so step 1 answers `ETARGET` there), the update story (bump `@objectstack/skills` with the other `@objectstack/*` packages, then re-run the sync), and the GitHub path once, as the `next` channel: the unreleased `main`, for trying the next version's skills, not for a released project. Nothing under `dist/skills/*/` changes.
