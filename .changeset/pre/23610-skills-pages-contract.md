docs(skills): the `objectstack-ui` pages rule says what a page type, template and region name run (#23610)

Clause-②: no

`skills/objectstack-ui/rules/pages.md` taught `home` as the app's landing page, `utility` as a floating utility panel, templates `two-column` / `single-column` and regions `left_sidebar` / `right_sidebar`, and `kind: 'jsx'` as a live alias of `html` — none of which the console draws or the spec accepts. The rule now states the declared contract: `home` is the widest region page and not a landing (an app opens on its first navigation item; `isDefault` on it is refused), `utility` is a narrow inline region page with no floating or docked shell slot, `template` is one of `default`, `header-sidebar-main`, `three-column` or `dashboard` with the regions each one places (`sidebar` left, `aside` right; `full-width` retired), a region the template does not place or a second region for a filled slot is refused at its `name`, and `kind: 'jsx'` is refused with the prescription `html`. Skill text only; nothing an author writes changes.
