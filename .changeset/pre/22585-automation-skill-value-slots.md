fix(skills): the automation skill teaches flow value slots as a CEL envelope or a literal and text slots as `{{ }}` holes; the single-brace `{…}` dialect leaves the catalog text

Clause-②: no

The `objectstack-automation` skill no longer lists `{$User.<path>}`, `{NOW()}` / `{TODAY() ± N}` or any other single-brace `{…}` token as a spelling a flow value slot still reads, and the remedies it gives no longer pass through a refused spelling. What the skill now teaches is what the platform accepts:

- A value slot — `assignments.*`, `fields.*`, a `subflow` / `map` `input.*`, a `script` `inputs.*`, a `loop` / `map` `collection`, a notify node's `recipients` / `templateData.*` / `sourceId`, an `http` node's `body`, each CRUD `filter` operand — takes a CEL value envelope `{ dialect: 'cel', source: '…' }` or a literal. A `{…}` token there is refused at `objectstack validate` (`expression-invalid`), `registerFlow` and the executor, naming its CEL spelling.
- A text slot — notify `title` / `message` / `actionUrl`, screen `title` / `description`, end `message`, `http` `url` and `headers` — renders `{{ }}` holes.
- The run user is `current_user.id`, guarded as `current_user != null ? current_user.id : null` in a flow that can run without a user; the date macros are `isoDate(today())`, `isoDate(daysFromNow(N))` / `isoDate(daysAgo(N))`, `isoDatetime(now())` and `isoDatetime(addDays(now(), N))`.
- A CRUD `filter` operand that is a whole-string query placeholder (`{current_user_id}`, `{today}`) passes through to the query engine untouched; an operand that evaluates to `null` refuses the node.
- A notify `recipients` value is one id, a list, or an envelope that evaluates to one, a list or `null` — a comma-separated string is one recipient.

The `objectstack-query` skill's filters rule names the value-slot judge (`expression-invalid`) in place of the retired lint rule `flow-filter-token-unknown`, and the automation eval set's two expected outputs that spelled a retired token move with the text.
