'@objectstack/lint': patch
---

Load the TypeScript compiler lazily in `validateReactPageProps` instead of at module top level (ADR-0081 Phase 2 follow-up).

`@objectstack/lint` sits on the kernel boot path, so the eager `import ts from 'typescript'` (framework#2482) made every boot parse the ~9 MB compiler (~70 ms+ on a warm laptop, worse on container cold starts) for a gate that only runs when a `kind:'react'` page is actually validated — a rare, trusted-tier case. It also hard-crashed boot in deployments that prune the package from the image (cloud's Docker pruner did exactly that; worked around in cloud#728).

- The compiler now loads on the first validated react-source page, via a deferred `createRequire` (same bundling-safe pattern as driver-sqlite-wasm's knex-wasm-dialect); the public API stays synchronous and unchanged.
- Importing the package, and validating stacks with no react pages, no longer touches `typescript` at all — so images that prune it boot fine and only fail (with an actionable error naming the package and the fix) if a react-source page is actually validated.
- `typescript` remains a regular dependency of `@objectstack/lint`.
- Guarded by a three-level regression test (structural no-eager-import scan, child-process probes of both dist formats, in-process lazy-load behavior), verified to go red if the eager import is reintroduced.
