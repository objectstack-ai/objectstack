docs(automation): every text that teaches a sender of an inbound `api` hook teaches the timestamped `x-objectstack-signature` form only — `t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex>`, the HMAC-SHA256 of `<t>.<raw body>` under the flow's secret, refused when `t` is more than 300 seconds from the server clock

Clause-②: no

The inbound hook door has accepted the timestamped form since `signHttpBodyAt` landed in `@objectstack/core`, and it is the only form that stops a captured post from verifying forever; the published teaching still showed the body-only `sha256=<hex>` form. The guidance converges first; the door's refusal of the body-only form is a later change of its own.

- **`@objectstack/skills`.** The `objectstack-automation` skill's Inbound webhook section teaches `t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex>`: `v1` is the HMAC-SHA256 of `<t>.<raw body>` under the start node's `secret`, and the door refuses a `t` more than 300 seconds from its clock. The body-only form is no longer shown.
- **`@objectstack/lint`.** The hint of `flow-api-trigger-secret-missing` and its `os explain` entry describe the same form. The rule's id, severity, verdict sentence and judgement are unchanged.
- The showcase example's comment and the platform checklist's intake recipe sign the same way.

**Nothing to migrate for an author.** A sender that already signs with `signHttpBodyAt` is unchanged. **The outbound contract stays as published:** the messaging outbox and the flow `http` node keep signing body-only (`signHttpBody`) for third-party receivers, and the inbound door's accept set is not changed by this release.
