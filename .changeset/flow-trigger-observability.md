Flow trigger observability — kill the four-layer silence around record-change flows that never fire (2026-07-17 third-party eval).

A misauthored auto-launched flow (wrong `objectName`, missing `requires: ['automation','triggers']`, failing start condition) produced ZERO output at every layer: the engine's own registration/binding logs land inside the CLI's boot-quiet stdout window (which swallows debug/info/warn — only error/fatal reach stderr), and each "didn't happen" path was itself silent. Fixes:

- **Startup banner `Flows:` section** (`os serve`/`os dev`/`os start`): flow count, bound-to-trigger count, registered trigger types, draft count — plus loud `⚠` lines for flows declared with no automation engine enabled (`requires` missing), flows whose trigger type has no registered trigger, and bound record-change flows targeting an unknown object (dead binding). Printed after stdout is restored, so it is immune to the boot-quiet window.
- **Trigger-fired run failures now log at ERROR** (stderr — always visible): the automation engine no longer drops the AutomationResult of a trigger-fired execution; condition-evaluation faults and node failures surface with the flow name. Condition-not-met skips stay at debug (high-frequency, intentional).
- **`RecordChangeTrigger` probes object existence at bind time** and warns when a flow's `objectName` matches no registered object (exact-name matching), instead of silently arming a hook that can never fire.
- **`kernel:bootstrapped` binding audit** in the automation plugin: warns per enabled-but-unbound triggered flow with the reason, and reports registered/bound/draft counts (`AutomationEngine.getTriggerBindingAudit()`, extended `getFlowRuntimeStates()` with `status`/`triggerType`/`object`).
- **`os validate` flow-wiring advisories** (`@objectstack/lint` `validateFlowTriggerReadiness`): warns when a record-triggered flow targets an object the stack does not define, and when an auto-triggered flow's status is `draft` (authored or defaulted — draft flows still fire; declare `active` or `obsolete`).
- Removed leftover boot-debug writes (`registerApp`/`AppPlugin`/`StandaloneStack`/`AuditPlugin` stderr noise) that previous debugging of this same silence had left behind.
