Honor a nested `where` filter inside `expand` on lookup/master_detail expansion.

The expand post-processor batch-loads related records with an `id $in [...]` query but never merged the nested QueryAST `where`, so a documented `expand: { rel: { where: {...} } }` filter was silently ignored and every related record came back. The nested filter is now AND-merged into the batch query via an explicit `$and` group (`{ $and: [{ id: { $in } }, nestedAST.where] }`) — robust against a nested filter that itself keys `id` or uses a top-level `$or`/`$and`, where a shallow spread would clobber or reorder the constraint.

`limit`/`offset`/`orderBy` remain intentionally not honored on the expand path: it batch-loads every parent's related records in one `$in` query and re-keys them per parent by foreign key, so a per-parent page size or ordering can't be expressed there. Docs and the schema `describe()` are updated to match, with a guard test asserting `limit`/`offset` are not pushed into the expand query.
