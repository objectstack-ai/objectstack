fix(skills): the `objectstack-data` field-types rule names all five formula `returnType` members, `'currency'` included, and the `currencyConfig` a currency formula carries (#22743)

Clause-②: no

`skills/objectstack-data/rules/field-types.md` taught a formula's `returnType` as the four-member set `'number' | 'text' | 'boolean' | 'date'`, and its formula example said `(no 'currency')`. `@objectstack/spec`'s `FieldSchema.returnType` is the five-member enum `'number' | 'text' | 'boolean' | 'date' | 'currency'`, and a formula whose `returnType` is `'currency'` carries its currency in its own `currencyConfig` — `CurrencyConfigSchema`, the same shape a `currency` field declares; absent, the mode is `dynamic`, the tenant default currency. The `formula` table row and the formula example now both state the five-member set and name `currencyConfig` as the carrier. The example's `CEL — record. prefixes required` comment, which restated the table cell above it, is removed to pay the skill's token ratchet. Nothing is said about how a currency formula renders.
