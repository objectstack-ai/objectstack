Marketplace Setup navigation is now plugin-owned (cloud ADR-0009): `MarketplaceProxyPlugin` carries the "Browse Marketplace" entry and `MarketplaceInstallLocalPlugin` carries "Installed Apps" — no plugin mounted (e.g. `OS_CLOUD_URL=off`), no entry, no dead page. The two entries are removed from `@objectstack/platform-objects`' setup-nav contributions (ADR-0029 K2 ownership handoff).
