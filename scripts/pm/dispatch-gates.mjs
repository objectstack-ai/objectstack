 * dispatch-gates (#7341 item 4) — map a card's file surface to the `check:*`
 * gate families that watch it, derived from the tree AT RUNTIME.
 *
 *   node scripts/pm/dispatch-gates.mjs <path> [<path> ...]   # e.g. packages/spec/src/data/filter.zod.ts
 *   node scripts/pm/dispatch-gates.mjs --self-test
 *
 * ## Why derived, never listed
 *
 * The step-5 dispatch template's "Local gates for this card" line is filled by
 * the PM, and the gate inventory is a thing that expires SAME-DAY: it grew
 * twice in one 2026-08-08/09 shift (#6672 added `check:kernel-hook-pairs`,
 * #6661 added `check:app-nav-i18n`), and even "the farm lives in lint.yml" is
 * a memory-shaped claim — measured on #7341's own dispatch-time survey, checks
 * also live in ci.yml / spec-liveness-check.yml / validate-deps.yml /
 * release.yml / showcase-smoke.yml. #6492 is the canonical incident for a
 * second copy of a list rotting inside prose (three mutually-contradicting
 * counts, drifting within one hour), and #6865 for relaying remembered
 * workflow facts into a dispatch prompt (four of six required-context names
 * lived in a different file than claimed). So this script embeds NO list of
 * checks and NO map from paths to checks: every run re-reads
 * `.github/workflows/*.yml`, resolves each `check:*` script through
 * package.json, and scans the check scripts' own sources for the path
 * literals they operate on. When the farm grows, the next run sees it.
 *
 * ## What the output means (and what it cannot promise)
 *
 * For each input path, checks are matched by the path literals discoverable in
 * their sources ("watch hints"). That derivation is honest but heuristic:
 *
 *   - a MATCHED check is one whose own source names a directory/file that
 *     covers the input path — high-signal, paste it into the dispatch prompt.
 *     It is printed as the RUNNABLE invocation (`pnpm --filter <pkg> run
 *     check:x` for a package-scoped gate, `pnpm check:x` for a root-scoped
 *     one), not as the bare script name: the bare name sends a dev to the root
 *     `package.json`, where a package-scoped gate is absent and therefore reads
 *     as nonexistent (#7440);
 *   - a check with NO discoverable path hints is listed once in the
 *     "repo-wide / undetermined" bucket. It is NOT known to be irrelevant —
 *     many gates read the whole tree (check:nul-bytes) or a convention rather
 *     than a path. The PM's judgment call stays a judgment call; what this
 *     script removes is the memory-shaped half (which named checks exist and
 *     where they live);
 *   - a CONVENTION-TRIGGERED check is one the path derivation can never reach,
 *     because it counts a population it computes for itself and so names no
 *     path literal to match. Those are derived from the change's KIND instead
 *     and printed under their own heading — see CHANGE_KIND_GATES.
 *
 * The output is print-only and exits 0 on a completed derivation; a run that
 * cannot read the workflows or package.json exits non-zero (#4690: unreadable
 * input must never look like an empty answer).

/**
 * Gates that fire on what a change IS, keyed by a mechanically-detectable
 * convention. Everything else in this script is derived at runtime and lists
 * nothing; this table is the one exception, and it is bounded on purpose.
 *
 * ## Why these cannot be derived like the rest
 *
 * The path derivation matches a gate when the gate's own source names a
 * directory that covers your file. Every gate here computes its population
 * instead of naming it, so no source carries a literal to match:
 *
 *   - the two test-file gates — one lints a glob set that lives in the shared
 *     ESLint config, the other walks the workspace members — sit permanently
 *     in the "undetermined" bucket;
 *   - `check:i18n` walks `packages/` at runtime for files NAMED
 *     `i18n-extract.config.ts` and re-extracts each owning package's bundles.
 *     Its source is worse than silent: the path-ish literals it does carry are
 *     its CLI prerequisite and stale-dist checks (`packages/cli/dist/commands/
 *     i18n/extract.js`, `packages/spec/dist`, measured — eleven hints, none of
 *     them the population). So it matches nothing AND, having hints, never
 *     reaches the "undetermined" bucket either: before this entry existed, an
 *     edit to `packages/services/service-messaging/src/objects/` — which
 *     regenerates that package's four bundles — printed the gate in NEITHER
 *     half of the output. A gate the derivation cannot mention at all is the
 *     one shape this script must not produce; it cost a PR a CI round.
 *
 * No per-card gate list derived from paths can ever name these, however the
 * derivation improves.
 *
 * ## Why a named table and not a wider heuristic
 *
 * The tempting generalisation — scan every discovered check script for
 * `*.test.ts`-shaped literals and call those the test-sensitive gates — was
 * measured against this tree and names 22 families, because a script's source
 * mentions test paths in its fixtures, its self-test and its comments.
 * "Mentions a test file" is not "counts test files", and 22 leads is the same
 * as none. So the pair is written down, and the cost of writing it down is paid
 * back by the two properties below.
 *
 * ## What the i18n entry still refuses to list
 *
 * Its `matches` does not enumerate the packages that own a bundle today — it
 * repeats the gate's own walk (`findI18nBundlePackages` mirrors `findConfigs`
 * in `scripts/check-i18n-bundles.mjs`: same skip set, same filename-plus-
 * `/scripts/` test). What is written down here is the KIND, not its
 * population, so a tenth package growing a bundle is matched by the next run
 * with nothing to update — the same runtime-discovery contract the workflow
 * and package.json reads already keep.
 *
 * ## How these entries stay honest
 *
 * - Every `name` here is resolved against the families actually discovered in
 *   the workflows at runtime. A gate that is renamed, retired or dropped from
 *   CI does not silently stop being suggested — the run prints it as STALE and
 *   says to fix this table. A hand-written list that reports its own rot is a
 *   different object from one that quietly ages.
 * - Each entry is deletable, with a stated criterion:
 *   - test-file entry: when a gate on it grows a discoverable path literal,
 *     the ordinary derivation names it and its line becomes redundant.
 *   - i18n entry: when `check-i18n-bundles.mjs` stops discovering its targets
 *     at runtime and names its POPULATION in its own source — a literal each
 *     owning package path starts with — the path half matches and this entry
 *     is redundant. Growing more prerequisite paths does not qualify; that is
 *     what it already has.
 *
 *   Delete an entry the day its criterion is met, not before.
