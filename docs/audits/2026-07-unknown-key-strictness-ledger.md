# Unknown-key strictness ledger — the authorable / wire / open triage (#4001)

**Date**: 2026-07-30 · **Issue**: [#4001](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectstack/issues/4001) · **Builds on**: #3405 / #3746 (the `ActionParamSchema` template), #1535 (`ObjectSchema.create` unknown-key error), ADR-0089 D3a (view/page strict), ADR-0078 (no-silently-inert-metadata), ADR-0049 (enforce-or-remove), ADR-0054 (ratchet idiom)

Zod's default is `.strip`: a key the schema does not declare is **silently
discarded** and the instance goes on parsing. On an authorable surface that is
the worst failure mode — the author (human or AI) gets a success envelope and
ships metadata that quietly ignores their config. This ledger is #4001 step 1:
the persisted classification of *which* `z.object` sites that default is wrong
for, so the `.strict()` ratchet advances on evidence instead of a one-shot
sweep. **1885 sites was never the target number** — a large share of the spec
is wire/response shape where strictness would be a forward-compat bug.

## Classification rule

One question decides the class: **who writes this schema's input?**

| Class | Input written by | Unknown-key policy |
|---|---|---|
| **authorable** | A human or AI author, into `*.object.ts` / `defineStack` config / Studio / MCP | `.strict()` + fixable error (the ratchet target) |
| **wire** | Another machine: server responses, connector payloads, runtime envelopes, persisted runtime state | stay tolerant (`.strip` / `.passthrough`); strictness here turns an upstream *addition* into our parse crash |
| **open** | Deliberately schemaless user data (record bodies, per-node-type `config`, React props) | stay open; a *sibling* contract validates it (e.g. a node executor's `configSchema`, #4027/#4040) |

Mixed files carry both — classify per schema, not per file. A **response-side
extension of an authoring schema** (e.g. `EffectiveObjectPermissionSchema`)
must explicitly `.strip()` back, because `.extend()` inherits `.strict()`.

## Standard wiring

`strictUnknownKeyError` in `shared/suggestions.zod.ts` (generalized from the
#3746 hand-rolled map) is the one factory every strict authoring schema wires:

```ts
z.object({ ... }, { error: strictUnknownKeyError({ surface, knownKeys, aliases, guidance, history }) }).strict()
```

- `aliases` — semantic near-misses edit distance cannot reach (`visibleWhen` →
  `visible`, `from` → `source`, `read` → `allowRead`).
- `guidance` — exact-key prescriptions: **tombstones for retired keys** (the
  rejection carries the upgrade — AGENTS.md Post-Task Checklist #3) and
  wrong-layer pointers (`apiOperations` is response-side; `objectName` belongs
  on the start node).
- Key lists live beside the schema and are **drift-guarded by tests** (an
  "accepts every declared key" probe), because the schema body is lazy.

Every ratchet step ships only with the empirical zero-breakage pass: full
`@objectstack/spec` suite + `tsc`, downstream consumer suites, and
`objectstack validate` on all three example apps. Inference is not evidence —
the first application of this gate (below) caught a real spec gap.

## Ratchet state

### Already strict before #4001 (for reference)

| Surface | Since |
|---|---|
| `data/object.zod.ts` — `ObjectSchema.create()` unknown-key error + `UNKNOWN_KEY_GUIDANCE` tombstones; strict capabilities / tenancy / CRUD-override blocks | #1535, #2377, #2763 |
| `ui/view.zod.ts` / `ui/page.zod.ts` — form/page component schemas | ADR-0089 D3a |
| `ui/dashboard.zod.ts`, `data/field.zod.ts` (blocks), `ai/agent.zod.ts`, `ai/tool.zod.ts` (blocks) | various |
| `ui/action.zod.ts` — `ActionParamSchema` (the template) | #3405 / #3746 |

### This step (#4001 Tier-A slice)

| Schema | File | Evidence class |
|---|---|---|
| `PermissionSetSchema`, `ObjectPermissionSchema`, `FieldPermissionSchema`, `AdminScopeSchema` | `security/permission.zod.ts` | A silently dropped key on the capability container is the ADR-0049 asymmetry itself; retired `contextVariables` (ADR-0105 D11) / `isProfile` (ADR-0090 D2) get tombstones |
| `FlowSchema`, `FlowNodeSchema`, `FlowEdgeSchema`, `FlowVariableSchema` | `automation/flow.zod.ts` | Most AI-authored surface; cloud#688 / #2419 class. Node `config` stays **open** (executor `configSchema` owns it, #4027/#4040) |
| `ActionParamSchema` re-homed onto the shared factory | `ui/action.zod.ts` | #3746 template, byte-identical messages |

**Findings log** — three real defects the gate caught in its first two runs.
All three had been invisible: each key was written by real code, silently
dropped at parse, and nothing failed.

1. **`PermissionSetSchema` could not represent `description`** — yet the
   built-in default sets author it and `plugin-security`'s Setup projection
   reads it (`permission-set-projection.ts`). Fixed contract-first: it is now
   a declared key.
2. **`PermissionSetSchema` could not represent the ADR-0010 protection
   envelope** — `MetadataPlugin`'s artifact loader calls `applyProtection` on
   **every** metadata type, and `getMetaItemLayered` → `saveMetaItem`
   round-trips a body carrying the stamped `_packageId` / `_provenance`. Every
   sibling registered type (object / view / app / dashboard / report /
   dataset / flow / agent / tool / skill / email_template) spreads
   `MetadataProtectionFields`; permission was the outlier, so the envelope was
   stripped on every parse. Now declared, with the author-facing `protection`
   block alongside it (translated generically by `applyProtection`).
   Caught by the dogfood gate as a hard 422 on the ADR-0094 overlay path.
3. **A dogfood fixture flow carried `sharingModel`** — an object-level OWD key
   copy-pasted onto `flowTouch` in `flow-touch-fixture.ts`, complete with an
   ADR-0090 "grandfather stamp" comment describing a gate that does not exist
   for flows. Exactly the #4001 failure mode in the wild: authored in good
   faith, silently discarded, believed to be in effect. Removed (the identical
   stamp on the fixture's *object* is real and stays).

5. **`position.test.ts` asserted a fictional hierarchy** (step 2) — see the
   entry below.
6. **The platform's own Account app declared `defaultOpen` on three navigation
   groups** (app step, PR B). `expanded` is the schema key; `defaultOpen`
   never was — so all three groups shipped COLLAPSED while their author
   believed they opened by default. Fixed at the producer, and the spelling
   now aliases to `expanded`. Note where this one was found: not in a tenant
   project, but in first-party platform metadata that had been shipping for
   releases.

This is the empirical argument for the ratchet: the inference "no metadata in
the repo carries unknown keys" was **false three times over**, and only the
strict gate could prove it. Note the asymmetry in the two schema gaps — both
were *inverse* drift (runtime writes a key the spec cannot express), which the
liveness ledger's per-property direction cannot see.

**Known sibling gap — CLOSED in step 2:** `identity/position.zod.ts` — the
other registered security type — also omitted `MetadataProtectionFields` while
`applyProtection` stamps it. Declared (with the author-facing `protection`
block) when `position` joined the ratchet.

4. **`position.test.ts` asserted a fictional hierarchy** (found in step 2 when
   `PositionSchema` went strict): the pre-ADR-0090 test "should accept position
   with parent" — plus four "real-world hierarchy" examples — authored a
   `parent` key on positions. It only ever "passed" because `.strip` ate the
   key; no position tree exists (ADR-0090 D3 finalized flatness; hierarchy is
   the business-unit tree). The tests were codifying the strip-era fiction as
   expected behavior. Rewritten: `parent` is now asserted to be *rejected* with
   the flatness guidance.

## File-level triage — the five authorable directories

Site counts are `z.object(` occurrences per file (2026-07-30, this branch).
Classification is per the rule above; **(p)** marks a provisional call made
from the file's exports/JSDoc rather than a full read — verify before
tightening (the #4001 "sharing-rule lesson": candidates, not verdicts).

### `ui/` — 192 sites

| File | Sites | Class | Note / next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action.zod.ts` | 8 | authorable | param schema strict (#3746); remaining blocks ride later steps |
| `view.zod.ts` | 51 | authorable | partially strict (ADR-0089); long tail of sub-blocks |
| `component.zod.ts` | 29 | authorable | **next candidate** — SDUI component defs; check React-prop open slots first (p) |
| `theme.zod.ts` | 14 | authorable (p) | authored themes |
| `app.zod.ts` | 11 | authorable | **strict as of #4001 PR B** — `AppSchema` + branding / area / context-selector / contribution, and the nav-item union converted to `z.discriminatedUnion('type', …)` (the union-error question, settled empirically: matched-branch-only errors, exact recursive paths, `toJSONSchema` clean). Per-target `params` stay open. PR A (#4142) tombstoned the seven audit-dead keys first |
| `dashboard.zod.ts` | 11 | authorable | partially strict |
| `widget.zod.ts` | 9 | authorable (p) | |
| `page.zod.ts` | 7 | authorable | partially strict (ADR-0089) |
| `chart.zod.ts` / `i18n.zod.ts` / `responsive.zod.ts` | 6+6+6 | authorable (p) | i18n label shapes are wide-open records by design — verify |
| `dataset.zod.ts` / `animation.zod.ts` / `dnd.zod.ts` / `keyboard.zod.ts` / `touch.zod.ts` | 4 ea | authorable (p) | interaction configs |
| `notification.zod.ts` / `offline.zod.ts` / `report.zod.ts` | 3 ea | authorable (p) | |
| `sharing.zod.ts` | 2 | authorable (p) | public-sharing config |

### `data/` — 163 sites

| File | Sites | Class | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `object.zod.ts` | 20 | authorable | top-level already guarded (#1535); inner blocks partially strict |
| `data-engine.zod.ts` | 14 | wire (p) | engine contract shapes |
| `external-lookup.zod.ts` | 12 | mixed (p) | authored config + wire results |
| `seed-loader.zod.ts` | 12 | mixed (p) | seed file shapes are authored; loader state is runtime |
| `field.zod.ts` | 11 | authorable | partially strict |
| `filter.zod.ts` / `query.zod.ts` | 11+10 | open | query dialect — user data flows through; validated semantically elsewhere |
| `driver-nosql.zod.ts` / `driver.zod.ts` / `driver-sql.zod.ts` | 10+9+2 | wire | driver capability contracts |
| `datasource.zod.ts` | 9 | authorable | **strict as of #4001 data step** — all 9: `DatasourceSchema` (+ `pool` / `healthCheck` / `ssl` / `retryPolicy`), `ExternalDatasourceSettingsSchema` (+ `validation`), `DatasourceCapabilities`, `DriverDefinitionSchema`. `config` + `readReplicas` stay `z.record` by construction (per-driver shapes; the driver's own `configSchema` validates them) — which is precisely why the top level had to close: a connection key written one level too high was stripped, and the datasource then connected on driver defaults instead of failing |
| `analytics.zod.ts` | 8 | mixed (p) | |
| `document.zod.ts` | 8 | wire (p) | |
| `hook.zod.ts` / `hook-body.zod.ts` | 6+2 | mixed | **strict as of #4001 data step** for the AUTHORING shapes: `HookSchema` (+ `retryPolicy`) and both body branches (`ExpressionBodySchema` / `ScriptBodySchema`). `HookContextSchema` and its `session` / `provenance` / `user` blocks are the RUNTIME shape the engine hands a handler — they stay tolerant, and must: strictness there would make an engine-internal enrichment (as `provenance` was in #3712) a breaking change for anyone parsing a context they were given. The file's old blanket `authorable (p)` was too wide — verification split it |
| `mapping.zod.ts` | 3 | authorable (p) | |
| `external-catalog.zod.ts` | 4 | wire (p) | |
| `field-value.zod.ts` / `seed.zod.ts` / `validation.zod.ts` | 1 ea | mixed (p) | |

### `automation/` — 80 sites

| File | Sites | Class | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flow.zod.ts` | 12 | authorable | **strict as of #4001** (4 schemas; `FlowVersionHistorySchema` is runtime — stays tolerant) |
| `sync.zod.ts` / `etl.zod.ts` | 12+10 | authorable (p) | authored pipelines — **candidates** |
| `trigger-registry.zod.ts` | 11 | mixed | descriptors are code-registered (wire-ish); bindings authored |
| `execution.zod.ts` | 8 | wire | run-state envelopes — never strict |
| `state-machine.zod.ts` | 7 | authorable (p) | |
| `control-flow.zod.ts` | 6 | authorable (p) | validated structurally by `validateControlFlow` |
| `bpmn-interop.zod.ts` | 5 | wire (p) | interop import shapes |
| `approval.zod.ts` | 4 | authorable | **strict as of #4001 step 3** — all four authoring schemas (node config / approver / escalation / decision-output). The published JSON schema carries `additionalProperties: false` into the Studio form AND `registerFlow()` config validation (#4027/#4040), so an unknown key in an approval node's `config` is rejected at registration too — verified: `z.toJSONSchema` on the strict lazySchema does not throw (#3746 hazard checked) |
| `node-executor.zod.ts` | 4 | wire | executor contract |
| `webhook.zod.ts` | 1 | authorable (p) | spec-only (#3461) |

### `security/` — 20 sites

| File | Sites | Class | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `explain.zod.ts` | 11 | wire | permission-explain responses — never strict |
| `permission.zod.ts` | 4 | authorable | **strict as of #4001**; `EffectiveObjectPermissionSchema` explicitly `.strip()`s (wire) |
| `rls.zod.ts` | 3 | authorable | **`RowLevelSecurityPolicySchema` strict as of #4001 step 2** (a stripped RLS key is a silent policy hole); `RLSUserContextSchema` / `RLSEvaluationResultSchema` are runtime shapes — stay tolerant |
| `sharing.zod.ts` | 2 | authorable | **strict as of #4001 step 2** — rule + recipient shapes; strictness and the error map ride the base into the criteria extension |

### `studio/` — 27 sites

| File | Sites | Class | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `object-designer.zod.ts` | 12 | authorable (p) | Studio-written JSON — machine-authored but *our* machine; strict protects the builder itself |
| `plugin.zod.ts` | 8 | mixed (p) | |
| `flow-builder.zod.ts` | 7 | authorable (p) | independent of `FlowSchema` shapes |

## Other directories (coarse; classify per schema before touching)

| Dir | Sites | Dominant class | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api/` | 426 | wire | REST/GraphQL request/response contracts — tolerant by design |
| `system/` | 383 | mixed | manifest/datasource blocks are authored; runtime envelopes are wire |
| `kernel/` | 351 | wire | plugin/kernel contracts, code-to-code |
| `cloud/` | 83 | wire | multi-tenant runtime |
| `ai/` | 75 | mixed | agent/tool/skill definitions authored (partially strict already); model/provider payloads wire |
| `integration/` | 64 | wire | connector payloads — upstream adds fields freely |
| `identity/` | 34 | mixed | position/user shapes authored (`PositionSchema` **strict as of #4001 step 2**, with the ADR-0010 envelope declared); auth payloads wire |
| `shared/` | 25 | n/a | utilities and building blocks; strictness decided at the consuming schema |
| `qa/` | 6 | n/a | test fixtures |

## Next steps (verify-then-enforce, one shape at a time)

1. Promote this ledger to a machine-checked gate (pattern of
   `packages/spec/liveness/` + `check:liveness`) once enough of the surface is
   classified that the table above is enforceable rather than descriptive.
2. Let the warning layer run in the wild for a release, then schedule the v18
   strict close-out on what it actually reports — which is the whole point of
   having built it. Nothing more to do here until there is field data.

Done in step 2: `security/rls.zod.ts` + `security/sharing.zod.ts` strict;
`PositionSchema` strict with the protection envelope declared (closing the
known sibling gap below).

Done in step 3: `automation/approval.zod.ts` — the four approval authoring
schemas, with the ADR-0019 re-home map as wrong-layer guidance
(`steps` / `entryCriteria` / `onApprove` / `onReject` / `rejectionBehavior`
each point at where the concept lives on the flow graph now).

Done in the app step, PR B: `AppSchema` + the navigation tree strict, via a
discriminated union — the union-error concern that deferred this step was
resolved by measurement, not design work.

Done in the app step, PR A: the seven audit-dead AppSchema keys tombstoned
(`retiredKey` + `app-dead-authoring-keys-removed` conversion + step-17
migration entry), clearing the enforce-or-remove precondition for the app
strict step (PR B).

Done in the data step: `data/hook.zod.ts` + `data/hook-body.zod.ts` +
`data/datasource.zod.ts` — the last two entries that carried a provisional
`(p)` classification. Verification changed the answer for one of them: the
blanket `authorable (p)` on `hook.zod.ts` was too wide, because
`HookContextSchema` in the same file is a runtime shape and stays tolerant.
Both types were confirmed authorable the same way — they sit in
`BUILTIN_METADATA_TYPE_SCHEMAS`, so one shape backs `defineStack()` parsing,
`/api/v1/meta/types/:type`, and the Studio form.

Measured while doing it, and worth recording because it contradicts the
assumption the earlier steps were written under: **strictness does not change
the published JSON Schema.** `build-schemas.ts` converts with the default
`io: 'output'`, and in output mode zod emits `additionalProperties: false` for
a `.strip()` object too — the post-parse shape genuinely has no extra keys.
Verified by regenerating both ways: `Datasource.json` is byte-identical before
and after. So the JSON Schema had been advertising `additionalProperties: false`
while the zod parse quietly accepted and dropped unknown keys. These flips align
the parse with the contract that was already published, rather than widening it.
(Note this cuts against the `approval.zod.ts` note above, which reads as though
the flip carried strictness INTO the JSON schema. It did not; approval's schema
would have said `false` regardless. The registration-time rejection it describes
is real, but it came from the published schema, not from the flip.)

## The warning layer (was "next step 1" — it already existed)

The `@objectstack/lint` unknown-key WARNING layer this list carried as a pending
next step **had already been built** by the time the data step landed: #3786's
`lintUnknownAuthoringKeys` plus #4167's `lintUnknownStackKeys`, exported from
`@objectstack/spec` and wired into `defineStack()`, `os validate` and
`os compile` as non-blocking warnings. Anyone reading this file for what to do
next was being sent to build something that shipped releases ago.

What was genuinely missing was **depth**, not existence. The walk covered each
metadata item's top level plus one hard-coded descent into `object.fields`,
which left 227 strip-mode objects nested below those roots reporting nothing —
concentrated exactly where authoring volume is: `object` 71, `view` 49,
`page` 24, `dashboard` 18, `agent` 16, `mapping` 14. Those sites were both
silently eating keys AND contributing nothing to the evidence base the v18
close-out is supposed to be scheduled on.

The walk now descends the authored value alongside its schema through nested
objects, arrays and records, applying the same posture rules (`strict` and
`passthrough` stay silent; only `strip` reports). Unions descend only when the
authored value picks a branch unambiguously — guessing would invent findings
against a shape nobody wrote. `object.fields` keeps reporting as `field` with
its curated guidance, now via an explicit override table rather than a special
case, so its own nested sites (`fields.*.options[]`, …) are covered too.

Audited after the change, since "our own assets are clean" has been wrong
before: 43 platform objects + 3 apps + 1 dashboard + 3 pages, and both example
apps (23 + 6 objects, 20 + 1 pages, 4 + 1 datasets, 3 + 1 dashboards) report
**zero** unknown keys. No finding this time — worth recording precisely because
the app step's `ACCOUNT_APP.defaultOpen` came from exactly this class of check.

Long tail stays gated on a verification pass per shape — never a one-shot
"make all ~453 sites strict" (ADR-0054 ratchet; #4001's own recommendation).
