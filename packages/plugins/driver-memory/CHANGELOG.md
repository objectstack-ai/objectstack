## 17.0.0-rc.1

### Major Changes

- 7309c81: fix(driver-memory,spec): persistence is opt-in again — `new InMemoryDriver()` is pure in-memory (#4065)

  `InMemoryDriverConfig.persistence` defaulted to `'auto'`, and in Node.js `'auto'`
  means **file**. So a bare `new InMemoryDriver()` — the shape every caller in this
  repo used — silently wrote `.objectstack/data/memory-driver.json` into the process
  CWD and reloaded it on the next boot. The default is now `false`.

  **This restores the accepted design rather than replacing it.** #815, the issue
  that introduced the persistence capability, specified it as opt-in in requirement
  \#1 — "默认情况下不启用持久化（纯内存，行为不变）" — and listed
  `new InMemoryDriver()` under "纯内存" in its own config examples. The `'auto'`
  default was a drift from that spec.

  What let the drift survive is worth naming, because it is not "there was no
  test". `MemoryConfigSchema` _did_ pin the default, and asserted `'auto'`; the
  driver honoured `'auto'`; so spec and implementation agreed, and the pair looked
  verified. What nothing checked was whether the value they agreed on was the one
  #815 accepted. The driver's own `persistence.test.ts` could not have caught it
  either — every case there passes `persistence` explicitly, so the omitted-value
  path was untested on the implementation side. Both sides are now covered: three
  behavioural tests in `persistence.test.ts` (no CWD write, no cross-instance row
  carry-over, opt-in still persists) and the flipped schema assertion.

  **The symptom this fixes.** `packages/runtime/src/datasource-autoconnect.test.ts`
  seeds two rows with fixed ids and asserts the exact set. Run 1 passed and wrote
  the rows to disk; run 2 loaded them back, appended two more, and failed with four
  rows; run N had 2N. CI never saw it — every job is a fresh clone, so every CI run
  is run 1 — but `pnpm test` twice in one working tree could only ever go green
  once. The persisted file's `created_at` values, one pair per run, were the proof.

  (#4083 fixed that particular suite from the factory side, and its regression
  test is kept as-is. The blast radius was wider than one suite, though: **every**
  bare `new InMemoryDriver()` inherited the default, so any code path constructing
  one directly wrote to its working directory. Unit tests should not have write
  side effects on the CWD at all.)

  **Migrating.** Callers that want durability now ask for it:

  ```ts
  new InMemoryDriver(); // pure in-memory (new default)
  new InMemoryDriver({ persistence: "file" }); // Node.js, durable across restarts
  new InMemoryDriver({ persistence: "local" }); // browser, durable across reloads
  new InMemoryDriver({ persistence: "auto" }); // previous default behaviour
  ```

  The `'auto'` / `'file'` / `'local'` / custom-adapter paths are unchanged; only
  the value used when `persistence` is omitted moved.

  **Relationship to #4083.** That issue fixed the same hazard one consumer at a
  time, and landed first: `createDefaultDatasourceDriverFactory` now passes
  `persistence: false` for a declared `{ driver: 'memory' }` datasource and scopes
  an opted-in destination _per datasource_, and the dev sqlite step-down's
  last-resort rung passes `false` too. Both are kept exactly as #4083 wrote them.
  This change closes the half they deliberately left open — a directly-constructed
  `new InMemoryDriver()` — which is the path that still wrote into the working
  directory of whatever process happened to build one.

  The two are complementary, not redundant. #4083's per-datasource scoping is
  still the only thing that expands `'auto'`/`'file'`/`'local'` into a destination
  carrying the datasource name, so two pools that DO opt in never alias one file;
  its explicit `false` becomes belt-and-braces, which is the right posture for a
  path that must never persist.

  `DevPlugin`'s driver is now explicitly `persistence: false`, matching the cache,
  queue, job, i18n, storage and search stubs it ships beside — it was the one piece
  of that stack that quietly outlived the process.

  **One claim trimmed, no behaviour attached.** The class docstring called this a
  "production-ready implementation of the ObjectStack Driver Protocol". It stores
  no constraints at all — `create()` is a `table.push()` and `syncSchema()` only
  allocates an array — so there is no primary key, uniqueness, `NOT NULL`, foreign
  key or column typing, and `bulkCreate` lands duplicate ids where a SQL driver
  raises a violation (the second finding in #4065). The docstring now says so, and
  points test authors at in-memory SQLite. Per Prime Directive #10 the fix for
  `declared ≠ enforced` is to implement it, trim the claim, or file it; with this
  driver moving to maintenance-only the claim is what goes.

### Minor Changes

- 270650f: feat(migrate): a datastore created from empty attests its data migrations at creation (#3438, ADR-0104 2026-07-30 addendum)

  Deployment-level migration flags could only be recorded by running
  `os migrate`. That left a hole at the other end of a deployment's life: a
  database created on a version that already ships the migrations started **lax**
  and stayed lax until someone thought to run a command that, for them, converts
  nothing and finds nothing. Every new deployment re-entered the warn regime, so
  the warn regime would never die out — and, since #3459, every new deployment
  also kept every released file forever.

  A store the platform **creates from empty** now records
  `adr-0104-file-references` and `adr-0104-value-shapes` at that moment. Nothing
  to run; enforcement and collection are live from the first boot.

  **This is not version-gating in disguise.** The fact recorded — no legacy value
  is stored here — is _observed_: the store had no history at all. The platform
  attests only what it watched itself create, and the test is deliberately
  strict: every table made by this boot and **none found already present**. One
  pre-existing table anywhere, one datasource that was already there, one driver
  that cannot account for its schema sync — any of those and the deployment
  attests nothing and produces its evidence by scan, exactly as before. "Found
  empty" and "created empty" are not the same claim, and only the second is an
  observation.

  **New surfaces.** `IDataDriver.getSchemaSyncStats?()` (optional, purely
  observational: tables created vs found since connect — implemented by the SQL
  and in-memory drivers), `engine.wasDatastoreCreatedFromEmpty()`,
  `attestFreshDatastore()` in `@objectstack/platform-objects/system`, and
  `VALUE_SHAPES_MIGRATION_ID` / `CREATION_ATTESTED_MIGRATION_IDS` in
  `@objectstack/spec/system`. Attestation never overwrites an existing flag row
  and never throws into a boot: a failure leaves the deployment lax, which a
  migration run can still fix.

  **Upgrading changes nothing for an existing database.** It is non-empty when
  the platform reaches it, so it is never attested — run
  `os migrate files-to-references --apply` as before. Importing legacy values
  into an attested deployment is rejected loudly at the write path;
  `OS_ALLOW_LAX_MEDIA_VALUES=1` re-opens leniency while you diagnose.

- 6f98c2d: fix(driver-sql,driver-memory): an uncompilable filter now throws instead of matching everything (#3948)

  A filter the driver could not compile was **skipped**, not rejected. No predicate
  was emitted and the query returned every row — the caller asked to filter and
  silently received the unfiltered set.

  The reachable shape is a bare comparison triple. `['close_date','before','2024-01-01']`
  arrives at a driver only when `isFilterAST()` refused it — its operator is outside
  `VALID_AST_OPERATORS`, so `parseFilterAST()` never converted it and the raw array
  was assigned to `where`. `driver-sql`'s loop then saw three _strings_, matched
  neither `and` nor `or`, and `continue`d past all three. `driver-memory` was worse:
  it cast every string to a logic keyword, opening three empty groups and returning
  `{}` — a filter matching every record.

  This is reachable from ordinary authoring, not just malformed input: `before` and
  `after` are canonical `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS` members that `VALID_AST_OPERATORS`
  does not accept. Eight of the nineteen canonical view operators are in that
  position, including `equals`; the others were masked only because ObjectUI's
  adapter alias table happened to cover them.

  **Behaviour change.** Both drivers now throw on a filter element that is neither a
  logical keyword (`and`/`or`) nor a condition array, and `driver-memory` throws on
  an operator it cannot express rather than dropping the condition. The nested and
  `$`-object paths already threw on the same input, so this makes the three paths
  agree. A caller that was relying on the old silence was receiving wrong results;
  the error names the operator and the offending filter.

  **`driver-memory` also gains seven operators it silently ignored:** `not_in`,
  `is_null`, `is_not_null`, `isnull`, `isnotnull`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty` — all
  members of `VALID_AST_OPERATORS`, all previously falling through to
  `default: return null`. `is_null` narrowed nothing instead of matching null rows.
  Alias sets and semantics mirror `driver-sql`'s `whereNull`/`whereNotNull` arms so
  the two backends accept one vocabulary.

  Migration: none for well-formed filters. If a query now throws, the filter was
  never being applied — fix the operator (the message names it), or lower it to an
  AST spelling. `before` → `<`, `after` → `>`, `'not in'` → `nin`.

### Patch Changes

- b3a2318: fix(driver-memory,driver-mongodb): a bare-day upper bound covers the whole day (#4042)

  The non-SQL half of #3777's calendar-day rule. Both drivers compiled a bare
  `YYYY-MM-DD` `$lte` (and a `between` max) as-is, so on timestamp values the
  window cut off at the final day's midnight — the dashboard date-range filter's
  default configuration (`created_at`, 7 of 13 presets ending "today") lost the
  current day, exactly as it did on SQL before #3777 was fixed.

  Both drivers now compile a bare-day upper bound half-open, sharing
  `nextUtcCalendarDay` from `@objectstack/core`:

  - `driver-memory`: the Mongo-style and array `where` spellings in the mingo
    lowering (`$lte`/`<=` → `$lt` next day; `$between`/`between` max the same),
    the analytics cube-filter `lte`, and the analytics `dateRange` window — which
    now also matches BOTH stored forms of a timestamp (ISO strings and `Date`
    objects) instead of only `Date`s, since mingo compares cross-type as
    never-equal.
  - `driver-mongodb`: the `translateFilter` lowering, all three spellings
    (`$lte`, `$between`, array `<=`/`lte`).

  Unchanged on purpose, matching the #3777 semantics table: full-ISO/`Date`
  comparands keep instant semantics, and `$gte`/`$gt`/`$lt` keep their midnight
  anchoring. Known remaining gap (tracked separately): values stored as BSON
  `Date` (mongodb) or JS `Date` (memory `find()`) never match _string_ comparands
  of any operator — a storage-form problem, not a bound-semantics one.

- 2e836de: chore(packaging): CHANGELOG.md ships in every npm tarball (#4261)

  The AGENTS.md post-task checklist requires breaking changesets to carry their
  FROM → TO migration because "this text ships to consumers as `CHANGELOG.md`
  inside the npm package and is what an upgrading agent greps after the tombstone
  error." That delivery path was severed for 68 of the 69 publishable packages:
  npm packs `package.json` / `README*` / `LICENSE*` unconditionally but — unlike
  older npm versions — not `CHANGELOG.md`, and the canonical
  `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]` whitelist never named it. Measured on npm
  10.9.7: `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/types` shipped 3 files while its
  70KB `CHANGELOG.md` stayed behind. Only `@objectstack/spec` listed it
  explicitly.

  The tombstone-error scenario is precisely the one where the repo is out of
  reach — the upgrading agent has `node_modules` and nothing else — so the
  migration text has to ride in the tarball. Every publishable package now
  declares `CHANGELOG.md` in `files`, and the canonical whitelist is
  `["dist", "README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]`.

  The other half is the gate: `check:published-files` gains a fifth invariant,
  COMPLETE — a whitelist that fails to cover `CHANGELOG.md` fails the
  always-required lint job, so the next package cannot silently sever the path
  again. `@objectstack/spec`'s per-package EXTRA_ENTRIES exemption dissolves
  into the canonical set.

  Consumer-visible change: one more file per install (the package's changelog,
  e.g. 70.8KB for `@objectstack/types`), and `grep -r "removed key"
node_modules/@objectstack/*/CHANGELOG.md` now finds the migration it was
  promised.

- 9e8f04d: fix(driver-memory,driver-mongodb): `Field.datetime` has one storage form per driver (#4047)

  The non-SQL counterpart of ADR-0053 D-B (#3912). Both drivers let the writer
  decide a datetime value's runtime type, and both compare across types by type
  bracket rather than by value — so a string comparand never matched a `Date`
  value, in either direction, for **every** operator including `$gte`.

  A datetime column genuinely held both forms: the drivers' own
  `created_at`/`updated_at` defaults bind a `Date` (mongo) or an ISO string
  (memory), while REST/JSON writes, relative-date tokens and `initialData`
  fixtures supply the other. A dashboard date window therefore answered with
  whichever half happened to match the comparand's type — on MongoDB, where
  `created_at` is a BSON `Date` and dashboard bounds are strings, that meant
  **no rows at all**, which is worse than the final-day loss #3777 fixed.

  Each driver now has one canonical form, applied on write and to every filter
  comparand:

  | Driver           | `datetime`                                                                                                           | `date`            |
  | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
  | `driver-mongodb` | BSON `Date` — the dialect's native instant, its `timestamptz`                                                        | `YYYY-MM-DD` text |
  | `driver-memory`  | canonical UTC ISO text (sorts chronologically under the string comparison mingo performs; survives JSON persistence) | `YYYY-MM-DD` text |

  Both learn their temporal fields from `syncSchema`, so an object that was never
  declared is left exactly as written — the drivers do not guess types from
  values. `driver-memory` additionally converges rows already in the table when
  the schema arrives, which catches `initialData` fixtures and anything a
  persistence adapter restored (the in-memory analogue of
  `backfillCanonicalDatetimes`, and idempotent like it).

  `Field.date` deliberately stays timezone-naive text on both — converting it to
  an instant would invent a midnight and re-couple it to a zone. The
  calendar-day bound semantics from #3777/#4042 are unchanged and now compose
  with the converged storage: the whole-day rewrite runs on the calendar string
  first, and only the resulting bound is converted to the storage form.

- 4384921: fix(spec,drivers): `bypassTenantAudit` becomes a declared driver option, and `findOne` stops accepting a bare id (#4311)

  Three drivers built with `tsup` and tested with `vitest`, so no `tsc` had ever
  read them. Onboarding them to the #4311 type-check ratchet surfaced 292 errors,
  and most of what looked like sloppy test fixtures was the types being wrong.

  **`DriverOptions.bypassTenantAudit` is now declared.** It has been live for a
  long time without being on the schema: `SqlDriver.auditMissingTenant` reads it
  to suppress the "tenant-scoped write without `tenantId`" warning, the driver's
  own warning text tells callers to set it, `ObjectQLEngine` sets it for
  system-context calls, and `service-settings` / `service-datasource` pass it on
  every global-scope write. Because the schema never had it, the driver read it
  through `(options as any)` and no caller was type-checked. The declaration
  states the limit as well: it silences a diagnostic and MUST NOT change which
  rows a write touches — suppressing an audit warning is not a permission.

  The same cast covered `timezone`, `tenantId`, `tenantIds` and `preserveAudit`,
  all long since declared. Those reads now go through `DriverOptions`, so the next
  undeclared option fails the build instead of hiding behind an existing cast.

  **`SqlDriver.findOne(object, id)` is removed.** An undeclared
  `typeof query === 'string' | 'number'` branch accepted a bare id. It was on no
  contract, nothing outside that package's own tests used it, and the other two
  drivers answered the identical call differently — `MemoryDriver` spreads the
  string into `{0:'t',1:'1'}`, `MongoDBDriver` reads `query.where` as `undefined`
  and returns an arbitrary row. It also bypassed the shared `findRows()` path, so
  it skipped field selection, temporal coercion, unknown-column recovery and the
  `singleRowLookup` ORDER BY decision. Spell an id lookup as the query it is:

  ```ts
  -(await driver.findOne("task", "t1"));
  +(await driver.findOne("task", { object: "task", where: { id: "t1" } }));
  ```

  **`SqlDriver.initObjects` declares the `tenancy` it consumes.** Each object is
  fed to `computeAndRecordTenantField`, which reads `obj.tenancy` to pick the
  tenant column and to set or clear the sticky explicit-opt-out — but the
  parameter type listed only `{ name, fields }`, so a caller that spelled the key
  correctly was rejected while the driver read it anyway.
  `registerExternalObject` already had it.

  **`AnalyticsQueryInput` joins `AnalyticsQuery`.** `timezone` is
  `.default('UTC')`, so the parsed type requires it and an authored literal does
  not have it — the same two-tier split `QueryInput`/`QueryAST` already names on
  the query side. `InMemoryDriver.create`/`bulkCreate` also declare their
  `IDataDriver` return types; without them TS inferred the literal the method
  builds and every other column of the created row disappeared from the caller's
  view.

  One silent runtime bug fell out of the same pass: a driver test asked for
  `orderBy: [['id', 'asc']]`, the driver reads `item.field`, a tuple has none, and
  the sort never reached SQL. The tuple spelling appears nowhere else.

- 8675db6: refactor(data)!: a select-list entry is a field name — the nested-select object form is removed (#4196)

  `FieldNode` declared two forms for one entry of `QueryAST['fields']`:

  ```ts
  type FieldNode =
    | string // "name"
    | { field: string; fields?: FieldNode[]; alias?: string }; // nested select
  ```

  The object form was **declared-but-inert**. Nothing produced it, and nothing
  read `.fields` or `.alias` — every consumer on the path treats the list as
  `string[]`: `objectql`'s formula projection and its two known-field filters,
  `driver-sql`'s `select()`, `driver-memory`'s `projectFields`. `driver-mongodb`
  keyed its projection with the entry itself, so an object entry asked for a
  column literally named `"[object Object]"`, and the REST ingress stringified
  each entry before comparing it to the field map, so the same entry came back as
  `400 INVALID_FIELD: Unknown field '[object Object]'` — a rejection naming
  something the caller never wrote. An author who wrote
  `fields: [{ field: 'owner', fields: ['name'] }]` got it accepted by validation
  and then dropped or mangled, depending on the driver (ADR-0078 silently-inert
  declaration; ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).

  The capability the object form described is already served, by a different key.
  Removing the second spelling rather than lowering it into the first is Prime
  Directive #12: one capability, one contract.

  **FROM → TO**

  | `fields: [{ field: 'total', alias: 't' }]`                        | `aggregations` / `windowFunctions` — they carry the live `alias` |

  The one-line fix: **a `fields[]` entry is a string.** Move nested selection to
  `expand`, which the engine resolves through batch `$in` queries (default max
  depth 3).

  There is no `os migrate meta` step, and deliberately so: `QueryAST` is a request
  shape, never stored in stack metadata, so the chain has no source to rewrite. It
  is registered as an ADR-0087 D3 **semantic** migration
  (`query-field-node-object-form-retired`) on the protocol-17 step instead — the
  `EnhancedApiError.fieldErrors` / `BatchOptions.validateOnly` precedent. Callers
  move their own select lists, and both channels tell them how:

  - **The parse.** `FieldNodeSchema` narrows to `z.string()` with an error map that
    answers an object entry with the prescription above, not "expected string,
    received object". `z.input` becomes `string`, so `tsc` fails at the authoring
    site first.
  - **The ingress.** `assertProjectionFieldsExist` judges the entry's _shape_
    before consulting the object's field map — it is wrong about the shape, not
    about this object, and a registry-less host would otherwise pass it to a driver
    that cannot read it. The 400 now names the retired form instead of the field
    `"[object Object]"`.

  No runtime behaviour changes for anything that ever worked; the defensive
  unwrapping the drivers had grown against a shape nothing sends goes with it.

- 6038de7: feat(spec,drivers): the temporal conformance matrix gains its `Field.time` axis — and `time` finally gets a storage form off SQL (ADR-0053 D-A3.2)

  `@objectstack/spec/data` gains `TEMPORAL_TIME_ROWS` / `TEMPORAL_TIME_CASES`,
  the wall-clock half of the shared matrix. A time gets its own table rather than
  a third `kind` on the existing one because it shares no comparand vocabulary
  with the other two: no relative token resolves to a wall clock, and the
  bare-day whole-day rule (#3777) must **not** reach it — which the table now
  asserts rather than assumes, since "the rule leaked into the wrong field type"
  is exactly what a conformance matrix is for. The fixture is a business day
  carrying the boundaries #3994 measured: both window edges, the pair straddling
  the millisecond-suffix width change, midnight and `23:59:59.999`.

  **The axis found a real gap on its first run.** ADR-0053 D-C gave `Field.time`
  a canonical form on every SQL dialect, but `driver-memory` and
  `driver-mongodb` were never extended — both declared
  `TemporalFieldKind = 'datetime' | 'date'`, so a `time` column was never
  classified and never coerced. It therefore held whatever each writer produced,
  and both stores compare across types by bracket: a text bound matched no
  `Date`-written row, in either direction, for every operator. Measured on
  `driver-memory`, **8 of the 9 shared cases** returned only the text-written
  half — a business-hours window answering `[d_mid, f_close]` instead of
  `[c_open, d_mid, e_mid_ms, f_close]`. This is #4047's failure one field type
  over, and it survived #4047 because that work extended `datetime` and `date`
  without revisiting `time`. On mongo it was also a documentation failure: that
  module's canon table has listed `time` as `HH:MM:SS[.fff]` text since #3994,
  and nothing implemented it.

  Both drivers now carry `storageTimeValue`, mirroring the SQL
  `canonicalTimeOfDay`: `HH:MM:SS`, `.fff` only when the milliseconds are
  non-zero, a `Date` / epoch / full-timestamp folding to its **UTC** time-of-day
  (never the host's), and totality — an out-of-range wall clock like `'25:00'`
  passes through rather than being silently rewritten. Text on both, mongo
  included: a wall clock is not an instant, so a BSON `Date` would invent a
  calendar day and a zone the author never wrote.

  If you have existing `time` data on either driver, values written as `Date`
  objects converge to canonical text on their next write; reads of un-migrated
  documents are unchanged. Filters were already unable to reach the mixed half,
  so no query that worked before stops working.

- 0166bd5: fix(spec,drivers): the view filter vocabulary and the AST vocabulary now agree (#3948)

  `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS` (`ui/view.zod.ts`) is what an author may declare on a
  `ViewFilterRule`. `VALID_AST_OPERATORS` (`data/filter.zod.ts`) gates
  `isFilterAST()`, which decides whether a filter is parsed into a query at all.
  They disagreed on **8 of 19** members: `equals`, `not_equals`, `greater_than`,
  `less_than`, `greater_than_or_equal`, `less_than_or_equal`, `before`, `after`.

  An author could declare any of them, `ViewFilterRuleSchema` validated them,
  `defineStack` accepted them — and then `isFilterAST()` refused the filter, the
  protocol passed the array through unconverted, and the driver could not apply it.
  Six of the eight were reachable only in theory because ObjectUI's adapter alias
  table happened to translate them; the safety of the query path was resting on a
  hand-written table in another repository being complete, and for `before`/`after`
  it wasn't.

  **`AST_OPERATOR_MAP` is now the single source of truth.** `VALID_AST_OPERATORS`
  is derived from its keys rather than restated, so an operator can no longer be
  accepted by the gate without also having a lowering — the two were separate
  hand-written lists that happened to agree, with nothing enforcing it. The map
  gained the eight canonical view spellings plus the squashed/short forms stored
  metadata carries (`notequals`, `greaterthanorequal`, `eq`, `gt`, …).

  **New export `canonicalAstOperator(op)`** folds every accepted spelling of one
  comparison onto a single infix form. Both drivers now call it instead of growing
  private alias lists, which is what let them accept different vocabularies.
  `like`/`ilike` are deliberately not folded onto `contains`: driver-sql passes them
  to SQL verbatim, so folding would silently wrap the value in `%…%`.

  Widening only — no spelling was removed, so no stored filter stops validating.
  A filter that previously produced an error (after #4029) or was silently dropped
  (before it) now compiles. `filter-view-operator-parity.test.ts` asserts every
  `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS` member and every `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATOR_ALIASES` key has a
  lowering that is a real `$`-operator rather than the `$${op}` fallback, so the
  next operator the view layer gains fails a test instead of a query.

### Patch Changes

- 69ae136: docs: align hardening / driver docs with the Hono-only adapter surface (12.0)

  Follow-up to the adapter trim (#2391): the hardening guide's rate-limit/CORS
  recipes are rewritten from Fastify to **Hono** (the shipped adapter; the old
  `@objectstack/fastify` import was broken), CSRF guidance points at `hono/csrf`,
  and stale `@objectstack/plugin-msw` references are dropped from the driver-memory
  and driver-turso docs. README framework lists narrowed to Hono.
