/**
 * ADR-0103 — engine-owned write guard for the `engine-owned` / `system` /
 * `append-only` buckets.
 *
 * `managedBy: 'engine-owned'` (and the locked defaults of `system` /
 * `append-only`) mean *engine-owned*: rows a platform service owns end to end
 * (the approval engine, the sharing engine, the job runner, the messaging
 * pipeline, …), written only via
 * `isSystem` / a service `SYSTEM_CTX` / a context-less engine call. Until this
 * guard that promise was enforced by nothing but UI affordances and default
 * permission sets — a wildcard admin could raw-write these rows through the
 * generic data API (ADR-0049 violation), exactly the hole ADR-0092's identity
 * write guard closed for `better-auth`.
 *
 * This is the `system`/`append-only` counterpart, keyed off the SAME contract
 * the UI and the `apiMethods` reconciliation use — {@link resolveCrudAffordances}
 * — rather than the raw bucket string. An object is engine-owned precisely when
 * its resolved affordances grant no write; the admin/user-writable members of
 * these buckets (the RBAC link tables, `sys_user_preference`, the messaging
 * config grids, …) declare `userActions` opening the verbs they legitimately
 * take, so they pass this guard and their real authz — the `DelegatedAdminGate`,
 * RLS self-grants, permission sets — adjudicates the principal, unchanged.
 *
 * A write is USER-CONTEXT when its context carries a real `userId` and is not
 * `isSystem`. `isSystem` and context-less engine/service writes bypass by
 * construction — that is exactly how the legitimate engine writers reach these
 * tables (the messaging service's raw-engine writes carry no session; the
 * metadata-protocol repository threads only a transaction handle; approval /
 * job / sharing services stamp `SYSTEM_CTX`).
 *
 * Denials raise {@link PermissionDeniedError} (HTTP 403), the same sentinel the
 * rest of `SecurityPlugin` throws. `better-auth` is deliberately NOT handled
 * here — it keeps plugin-auth's identity write guard, whose field-whitelist and
 * session-snapshot-refresh semantics differ.
