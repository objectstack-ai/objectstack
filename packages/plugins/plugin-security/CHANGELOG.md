### Patch Changes

- 574e7a3: Security: platform admins see all rows of better-auth-managed identity objects (ADR-0024 / cloud#551)

  Identity tables managed by the auth library (`managedBy: 'better-auth'` — `sys_oauth_application`, `sys_account`, `sys_session`, `sys_sso_provider`, …) are written by better-auth's own adapter with **no tenant context**, so `organization_id` is never stamped and `member_default`'s wildcard `tenant_isolation` RLS denies every row — a platform admin's Setup list (OAuth Applications, Identity Links, …) renders **empty**.

  These objects now get the **same posture-gated superuser bypass** as `private` / `tenancy.enabled:false` objects, so a platform admin's `viewAllRecords` sees all identity rows env-wide. This is **admin-only**: non-admins never trigger the bypass — their `_self` carve-outs / `tenant_isolation` still apply (verified by a regression test that a member stays tenant-scoped), and the flag is deliberately **not** used for the wildcard-policy drop, so it can never leak rows to members.

  Fixes the empty-list symptom across all better-auth-managed Setup objects without per-object `tenancy` changes (which would risk the control plane, where some of these objects ARE cross-env-isolated).

### Minor Changes

- e16f2a8: **BREAKING:** the system object `sys_department` is renamed to `sys_business_unit`
  — object + member table (`sys_department_member` → `sys_business_unit_member`),
  fields, and i18n — with **no compatibility alias**. Any deployment holding
  `sys_department` rows, or metadata that references the object by name (lookups,
  list views, queries, sharing/approval scopes), must migrate to `sys_business_unit`.
  A renamed shipped system object is a breaking change to the platform's public
  data surface, so this lands as a **major**. Verified per ADR-0059's pre-publish
  hotcrm gate: no published downstream consumer references the old name.

  ADR-0057 — ERP authorization core. Adds permission-grant access DEPTH
  (`own`/`own_and_reports`/`unit`/`unit_and_below`/`org`), renames `sys_department`
  → `sys_business_unit` (no aliases — see BREAKING above), introduces the platform-owned
  `sys_user_role` assignment, and seeds stack-declared `roles`/`sharingRules` into
  `sys_role`/`sys_sharing_rule` at boot (closes #2077). Hierarchy-relative scopes are
  delegated to a pluggable `IHierarchyScopeResolver` (open edition fails closed to
  owner-only; `defineStack` errors without `requires: ['hierarchy-security']`). Also
  fixes a latent over-grant where `engine.find({ filter })` was ignored (driver reads
  `where`) — normalized `filter`→`where` in the engine.

- cfd86ce: ADR-0058 — expression & predicate surface unification. Adds the canonical
  CEL→FilterCondition pushdown compiler in `@objectstack/formula`
  (`compileCelToFilter`, `isPushdownableCel`, `lowerCelAst`) plus an in-memory
  `matchesFilterCondition` backend (one AST, three backends). `plugin-security`
  (RLS `using`, via a SQL bridge) and `plugin-sharing` (`celToFilter`) cut over to
  it, retiring the bespoke regex/field-equality front-ends. Compound sharing
  conditions now compile and enforce end-to-end (closes #1887). The RLS `check`
  clause is now enforced on the write post-image (insert/by-id update), fail-closed.
  Non-pushdownable predicates (arithmetic, functions, subqueries, cross-object) are
  an authoring compile error, never silently dropped (ADR-0049/0055).
- 6ca20b3: ADR-0058 D1 follow-through — RLS predicates are now canonical CEL. Migrated every
  seeded RLS `using`/`check` (default permission sets, showcase, and the
  `RLS.ownerPolicy`/`tenantPolicy`/`allowAllPolicy` helper factories) from the
  legacy SQL-ish form (`=`, `IN (...)`) to pure CEL (`==`, `in`), so authors and AI
  learn ONE expression language. The `sqlPredicateToCel` bridge is retained as a
  DEPRECATED transitional shim: a stored SQL-style predicate still compiles (no
  silent deny on legacy data) but emits a deprecation warn; canonical CEL passes
  through as a no-op. No runtime behavior change — CEL and the old SQL form compile
  to the identical FilterCondition.

## 9.11.0

### Minor Changes

- fa8964d: feat(security): RLS predicates that won't compile are surfaced, not silently dropped (ADR-0056 D4)

  The RLS compiler previously dropped any `using`/`check` it could not parse (e.g. `==`,
  `AND`/`OR`, ranges) in silence — if it was the only policy, the object lost protection
  with no signal (the class of bug that left a showcase owner predicate inert for two PRs).
  Now the compiler WARNS (via the security plugin's logger) when an **unsupported-shape**
  predicate is dropped, distinguishing it from the intentional "context variable absent"
  fail-closed skip. Also exports `isSupportedRlsExpression(expr)` so an authoring-time gate
  (`objectstack compile`) can reject a predicate the runtime would never enforce. No change
  to compiled filters for valid predicates; fail-closed semantics preserved.

- 6595b53: feat(security): app-declarable default profile (`isDefault`, ADR-0056 D7)

  An app can now declare its default access posture for authenticated users who have
  no explicit grants, via `isDefault: true` on a permission set — instead of always
  inheriting the built-in `member_default`. The SecurityPlugin resolves the fallback
  from the `isDefault` profile when no explicit `fallbackPermissionSet` is configured
  (falling back to `member_default` when none is declared — non-breaking). This is the
  foundation for SSO/JIT provisioning (mapping IdP claims → a declared default profile).
  Proven by the `showcase-default-profile` dogfood test: a sign-up governed by a custom
  default that grants only `showcase_announcement` can read it but is denied
  `showcase_private_note` (which the `member_default` wildcard would have allowed).

- 751f5cf: feat(security): declaration-derived public-form authorization (ADR-0056, Option A)

  Public form submissions are now authorized by the **declaration**, not by a
  deployment-configured `guest_portal` profile. The form-submit route derives a narrow
  `publicFormGrant: { object }` from the matched form's target object; the SecurityPlugin
  honors it as a least-privilege capability — **create + the immediate read-back on THAT
  object only**, with no userId, and crucially NOT the anonymous fall-open. This makes
  public forms work under secure-by-default (`requireAuth`) **without** a hand-configured
  `guest_portal`, scoped to exactly the declared object (the field allow-list is still
  enforced at the route; `guest_portal`/`anonymous` are kept on the context for back-compat
  with guest-detection hooks). It is the prerequisite that unblocks the eventual
  `requireAuth` default flip, and generalizes the platform principle "public access =
  declared + runtime-derived scoped grant" (the same shape share-links already use).
  Proven by `form-self-auth` dogfood (create on target allowed; cross-object + update/delete
  denied). plugin-security 108, rest 121, full dogfood 98 — no regression.

- 5a5a9fe: feat(security): public-form demo (Option A) + app-declared default profile wiring (ADR-0056 D7)

  Wires ADR-0056's app-declarable default profile through the CLI so it actually
  takes effect under `pnpm dev`. `@objectstack/plugin-security` exports a new
  `appDefaultProfileName(permissions)` helper that extracts the first
  `isProfile && isDefault` profile name from a stack; `@objectstack/cli` (`serve.ts`)
  passes it as the SecurityPlugin `fallbackPermissionSet` (undefined → built-in
  `member_default` preserved, so apps that declare no default are unaffected).

  The showcase gains a working web-to-lead **public form** (`showcase_inquiry` +
  an `allowAnonymous` FormView authorized by the declaration-derived
  `publicFormGrant`, no `guest_portal` profile) and an app-declared default
  profile (`showcase_member_default`), each covered by a dogfood proof over the
  real HTTP stack.

- 4c213c2: Master-detail "controlled by parent" permissions (ADR-0055).

  A detail object can now declare `sharingModel: 'controlled_by_parent'`: its read/write access is derived from its master record, with no authored RLS.

  - `@objectstack/spec`: `controlled_by_parent` added to the authorable `object.sharingModel` enum.
  - `@objectstack/plugin-security`: reads inject `masterFK IN (accessible master ids)` (resolved from the master's own RLS, reusing the existing filter machinery — zero RLS-compiler changes); by-id writes (insert/update/delete) to a detail now require edit access to its master, closing the #1994-class by-id hole for derived access.
  - `@objectstack/verify`: related-record **topological synthesis** — `deriveCrudCases` no longer skips objects with required relations; it builds the object dependency graph, orders it topologically, and threads real target ids, so relationship-dense objects (and the master-detail RLS proof) are verifiable. Honest `blocked` verdicts remain for required-reference cycles and external/missing targets.

  v1 limits (per ADR-0055): the accessible-master id set is unbounded (large-tenant scale is a documented future limit), and master-detail chains are single-level (not transitively traversed).

- 2afb612: feat(security): resolve `current_user.email` in RLS owner policies

  RLS `using` predicates can now reference **`current_user.email`** — a unique,
  human-readable, _seedable_ owner anchor (`owner = current_user.email`). Previously
  the RLS compiler resolved only `current_user.id` / `organization_id` / `roles` /
  `org_user_ids`, so any owner-by-name/email predicate silently compiled to the
  deny sentinel (fail-closed → the user saw nothing). Email is sourced for free
  from the auth session (with a bounded `sys_user` fallback for the API-key path)
  and threaded onto the `ExecutionContext` in both identity resolvers — the REST
  data path (`rest-server`) and the dispatcher path (`resolve-execution-context`).

  Display `name` is deliberately **not** exposed to RLS: names collide, and a
  collision on an ownership predicate is an access-control leak. Only unique
  identifiers (`id`, `email`) are resolvable.

  This makes owner-scoped row-level security work with seed data (no per-user ids
  needed) and, combined with `controlled_by_parent` (ADR-0055), lets a master's
  owner scoping flow to its detail records. The example-showcase demonstrates it:
  `showcase_invoice` carries an `owner` email + an owner RLS policy, its lines are
  controlled-by-parent, and invoices/lines are seeded per owner. It also fixes the
  showcase's previously inert owner predicates (they used `==` and `current_user.name`,
  neither of which the compiler accepts) to `= current_user.email`.

## 9.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f88fd9: Converge the RLS contract with the reference compiler, and wire §7.3.1 dynamic membership.

  - **spec (docs)**: narrow `rls.zod.ts` to the four expression forms the compiler actually implements — `field = current_user.<prop>`, `field = 'literal'`, `field IN (current_user.<array>)`, and `1 = 1`. Removed the over-promised surface (subqueries, `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`, `LIKE`/`ILIKE`, regex, `ANY`/`ALL`, `NOT IN`, `IS NULL`, `NOW()`/`CURRENT_DATE`) from the operator list, context-variable list, and `@example` policies, and documented the fail-closed behaviour explicitly.
  - **spec (schema)**: `ExecutionContext` gains `rlsMembership?: Record<string, string[]>` — a bag of pre-resolved dynamic-membership id arrays (team members, territory accounts, shared records) that the runtime stages so RLS can scope via `field IN (current_user.<key>)` without subquery support. Generalizes the previously hard-coded `org_user_ids`.
  - **plugin-security**: `RLSCompiler.compileFilter` merges `rlsMembership` keys into the user context (arrays only, never clobbering the named `id`/`organization_id`/`roles`/`org_user_ids` fields), so §7.3.1 hierarchy- and sharing-based policies compile. `compileExpression` now recognizes `1 = 1` as always-true (empty filter), making `RLS.allowAllPolicy` grant access instead of silently failing closed. Missing/empty membership sets still fail closed.

- e2b5324: feat(ownership): auto-provision a canonical `owner_id` and hand seeded records to the first admin

  Ownership is now correct-by-default instead of opt-in — closing the gap where
  seeded demo data ended up owned by nobody a human can log in as (so "My" views,
  owner reports and owner notifications were empty out of the box) and where
  author-written objects silently shipped with no working ownership at all.

  - **`applySystemFields` (objectql)** now auto-injects a canonical, reassignable
    `owner_id` lookup (→ `sys_user`) on user-authored business objects, alongside
    the existing tenant/audit fields. Unlike the audit `*_by` lookups it is NOT
    readonly — ownership transfers. Withheld for `managedBy` / `sys_*` tables and
    for objects that opt out via `ownership: 'org' | 'none'` (Dataverse-style). The
    safe default direction: forgetting the opt-out leaves a harmless spare column,
    whereas the old opt-IN model let authors ship objects with broken ownership.
    Once present, the existing machinery engages automatically (insert auto-stamp,
    owner-scoped RLS, owner-keyed views/reports).

  - **`claimSeedOwnership` (plugin-security)**, invoked from `bootstrapPlatformAdmin`
    right after the first human is promoted to platform admin, transfers ownership
    of seeded rows (`owner_id` NULL or `usr_system`) to that admin. The ownership
    twin of org-scoping's `claimOrphanOrgRows`. Idempotent; skips `managedBy` /
    `sys_*`. Authors write plain seed records (no `owner_id`) and the platform —
    not the author — performs the handoff, so there is nothing to remember or
    mistype.

  - **`usr_system` is never minted (runtime + objectql).** The seed loader binds
    `os.user` to a NULL identity, so `cel`os.user.id``resolves to NULL at seed
time (the owning admin does not exist yet) and the row seeds NULL-owned — then
the handoff above fills it. The runtime's`ensureSeedIdentity`(the only code
that inserted a`usr_system`row) is removed.`SystemUserId.SYSTEM`survives
only as a reserved id so legacy DBs' exclusion guards / ownership handoff still
recognize a pre-existing row.`os.org`is unaffected (derived from`organizationId`).

  Also hardens `bootstrapPlatformAdmin` against a latent dts typecheck error
  (defensive read of the untyped `description` on seed permission sets).

### Minor Changes

- 92d75ca: fix(security): enforce row-level security on by-id writes — close the member-can-edit-others'-records hole (#1985).

  A single-id `update`/`delete` goes straight to `driver.update(object, id, …)` / `driver.delete(object, id)` and builds no query `ast`, so the RLS `where` filter the middleware injects on the read path was **never applied to by-id writes**. Combined with `member_default` granting `*: { edit, delete }` (scoped, by design, via the `owner_only_writes/deletes` RLS), this meant the owner predicate was silently bypassed: **any authenticated member could modify or delete another user's records** (verified end-to-end — a member PATCH'd an admin's record and the change persisted).

  Two coordinated changes:

  - **Enforce a pre-image authorization check.** Before a single-id `update`/`delete`, the security middleware computes the write-operation RLS filter and re-reads the target row with `{ id } AND <writeFilter>`; if the row isn't visible (someone else's, or RLS-hidden) it throws `PermissionDeniedError` (403). Reuses the existing RLS/tenant machinery, is recursion-safe (a `find` doesn't trigger the check), and is skipped when no RLS policy applies (e.g. admin sets, `modifyAllRecords`) so admins and unguarded objects are unchanged.
  - **Repoint owner scoping to a column that exists.** `owner_only_writes`/`owner_only_deletes` keyed on `owner_id`, which author-defined objects almost never declare — so the policy referenced a missing column and `computeRlsFilter` dropped it (the no-op that made the bypass invisible). Now keyed on `created_by`, the ownership column the engine stamps on every object.

  Result: a member may edit/delete the records they created, not others'; admins (and any set with `modifyAllRecords` or no RLS) are unrestricted. Objects that opt out of audit fields (`systemFields.audit: false`) have no `created_by` and now fail **closed** for member writes (grant `modifyAllRecords` or a per-object policy to allow). Objects modeling transferable ownership should override with a per-object owner policy.

  Verified live on app-crm (2 users): member→others' record PATCH/DELETE = 403 (unmutated); member→own = 200; admin→any = 200. Note: cross-tenant write isolation additionally depends on an organization being assigned at sign-up (tracked separately in #1985).

### Patch Changes

- 1e8b680: fix(security): close four P0 launch-readiness findings

  - **plugin-auth (P0-1):** `generateSecret()` now throws (fails boot) when no
    `OS_AUTH_SECRET` is set and `NODE_ENV==='production'`, instead of silently
    falling back to a predictable `dev-secret-<timestamp>` (session forgery). The
    dev/test fallback is unchanged.
  - **plugin-security (P0-2):** the permission-resolution `catch` now **fails
    closed** — it logs at ERROR and throws `PermissionDeniedError` rather than
    `return next()`. A degraded metadata service can no longer let every
    authenticated request bypass RBAC/RLS. System operations still bypass as before.
  - **driver-sql (P0-3):** the `contains` / `$contains` operator now escapes LIKE
    metacharacters (`%` / `_` / `\`) in the user value and binds an explicit
    `ESCAPE '\'`, so a value of `%` matches literally instead of every row
    (filter bypass). Correct across SQLite/MySQL/Postgres.
  - **driver-mongodb (P0-4):** the field-operator translator now rejects unknown
    `$`-operators instead of passing them through, blocking `$where` / `$function`
    / `$expr` (server-side JS execution / query-intent bypass). All legitimate
    ObjectQL operators remain allowlisted.

  +12 regression tests across the four packages.

### Minor Changes

- e478e0c: ADR-0029 K2 — security domain ownership (RBAC + sharing) + Setup nav contributions.

  Moves the security objects out of the `@objectstack/platform-objects` monolith
  into the two capability plugins that already register and operate them, split by
  concern (the two are orthogonal — sharing objects never reference RBAC objects):

  - **`@objectstack/plugin-security`** (RBAC) gains `sys_role`,
    `sys_permission_set`, `sys_user_permission_set`, `sys_role_permission_set`,
    and the `defaultPermissionSets` seed (which its `bootstrap-platform-admin`
    already consumes). The RBAC + default-permission-set tests move with them.
  - **`@objectstack/plugin-sharing`** gains `sys_record_share`,
    `sys_sharing_rule`, `sys_share_link`.
  - `@objectstack/platform-objects` no longer defines/exports any security
    objects; the `/security` subpath is now an empty barrel. Runtime is unchanged
    (both plugins already registered these objects at runtime).

  **D7 navigation** — the Setup app's `group_access_control` is now assembled from
  three sources: `plugin-security` contributes Roles / Permission Sets (priority
  100), `plugin-sharing` contributes Sharing Rules / Record Shares (priority 200),
  and `platform-objects` keeps only API Keys (`sys_api_key`, an identity object,
  priority 300) — preserving the original menu order.

  **i18n (D8)** — the objects are removed from the `platform-objects` i18n extract
  config; existing generated bundles keep working at runtime (object-name keyed).
  Migrating the i18n extraction to the owning plugins remains the tracked
  follow-up.

### Patch Changes

- 4404572: ADR-0029 D8 — migrate i18n ownership for the moved domains to their plugins.

  The object translations for the domains decomposed in K2.a/K2.b/K2 previously
  lived in the `@objectstack/platform-objects` generated bundles even though the
  objects now live in their capability plugins. This moves each domain's i18n
  extraction + bundles to the owning plugin, preserving every hand-translated
  string (zh-CN / ja-JP / es-ES):

  - Each plugin gains a build-time `scripts/i18n-extract.config.ts` and a
    `src/translations/` bundle (`{locale}.objects.generated.ts` + an `index.ts`
    barrel), generated with `os i18n extract` and self-baselined so re-runs
    preserve translations.
  - Each plugin loads its bundle at runtime on `kernel:ready` via
    `i18n.loadTranslations` (the i18n service is optional — load is best-effort).
    - `plugin-webhooks` ← `sys_webhook`, `sys_webhook_delivery`
    - `plugin-approvals` ← `sys_approval_request`, `sys_approval_action`
    - `plugin-security` ← `sys_role`, `sys_permission_set`,
      `sys_user_permission_set`, `sys_role_permission_set`
    - `plugin-sharing` ← `sys_record_share`, `sys_sharing_rule`, `sys_share_link`
  - `@objectstack/platform-objects` translation bundles are regenerated to drop
    those objects' keys (its extract config already excluded them); all other
    objects' translations and the metadata-form bundles are preserved.

  Net runtime effect is unchanged (same translations load, now contributed by the
  package that owns each object) — closing the D8 follow-up tracked since K2.a.

- 08fbbb4: Fix: the first-boot platform-admin promotion no longer gets stolen by the
  `usr_system` seed identity, and the dev seed admin uses fixed, well-known
  credentials.

  **`@objectstack/plugin-security` — `bootstrapPlatformAdmin` skips the system user**

  `5e831dea3` (#1392) added `ensureSeedIdentity` to the runtime SeedLoader,
  which upserts a non-loginable system identity (`usr_system`, role `system`,
  `system@objectstack.local`) to own seeded records — created _before_ the first
  human sign-up. Because `bootstrapPlatformAdmin` promoted the **earliest-created**
  `sys_user`, on any app that ships seed data `usr_system` won the promotion and
  the real admin login stayed at `role: user`. Login succeeded but Setup and
  Studio (gated by `setup.access` / `studio.access` on `admin_full_access`) were
  invisible — a silent, confusing regression.

  `bootstrap-platform-admin.ts` now filters out the system account
  (`id === SystemUserId.SYSTEM || role === 'system'`) when picking the first user
  to promote, and the "an admin already exists" short-circuit ignores any
  `admin_full_access` grant held by `usr_system` — so a database where it was
  wrongly promoted self-heals on the next boot.

  **`@objectstack/cli` — `os dev` seeds `admin@objectos.ai` / `admin123`**

  The `--admin-email` / `--admin-password` defaults changed from
  `admin@dev.local` / `admin12345` to the fixed, well-known
  `admin@objectos.ai` / `admin123`, so tooling and docs never have to guess the
  seeded credentials. Override with `--admin-email` / `--admin-password`.

### Major Changes

- 3a630b6: **Split organization-scoping from `@objectstack/plugin-security` into a new `@objectstack/plugin-org-scoping` package.**

  Per ADR-0002, "tenant" in ObjectStack means _physical_ isolation (one Environment = one database, handled by `@objectstack/driver-turso`'s multi-tenant router). The row-level `organization_id` scoping that previously lived inside SecurityPlugin is a different concept — _logical_ scoping inside a single DB — and now ships as its own plugin.

  ### Breaking changes — `@objectstack/plugin-security`

  - Removed the `multiTenant` constructor option. SecurityPlugin no longer touches `organization_id` on insert and no longer registers the `sys_organization` post-create seed pipeline.
  - Wildcard `current_user.organization_id` RLS policies in the default permission sets are now stripped UNLESS the new `org-scoping` service is registered (i.e. unless `OrgScopingPlugin` is also installed).
  - Removed export `cloneTenantSeedData` (now exposed as `cloneOrgSeedData` from `@objectstack/plugin-org-scoping`).
  - `bootstrapPlatformAdmin()` no longer accepts a `multiTenant` flag and no longer auto-creates a default organization — that behavior moved to `ensureDefaultOrganization()` in the new plugin.

  ### Migration

  Single-tenant deployments — no action required.

  Multi-tenant deployments (previously `new SecurityPlugin({ multiTenant: true })`):

  ```diff
  + import { OrgScopingPlugin } from '@objectstack/plugin-org-scoping';
    import { SecurityPlugin } from '@objectstack/plugin-security';

  + await kernel.use(new OrgScopingPlugin());     // MUST be BEFORE SecurityPlugin
  - await kernel.use(new SecurityPlugin({ multiTenant: true }));
  + await kernel.use(new SecurityPlugin());
  ```

  The runtime's `OS_MULTI_TENANT` env switch — read by `@objectstack/runtime/cloud/ArtifactKernelFactory`, `@objectstack/plugin-dev`, and the `objectstack` CLI's `serve` / `dev` / `start` commands — automatically registers `OrgScopingPlugin` when set to `true`, so projects driven by the CLI need no code changes.

### Patch Changes

- b806f58: Scope `sys_user` visibility to fellow organization members.

  The default RLS policy on `sys_user` was `id = current_user.id`, which meant
  @-mention pickers, owner/assignee lookups, reviewer selectors and the user
  roster all returned just the current user. The RLS compiler doesn't support
  subqueries, so a `id IN (SELECT user_id FROM sys_member ...)` policy isn't
  expressible.

  This change:

  1. Pre-resolves `org_user_ids` (the IDs of all users in the active org) into
     `ExecutionContext` in **all three** REST entry-point resolvers
     (`@objectstack/rest`, `@objectstack/runtime`, `@objectstack/plugin-hono-server`).
  2. Adds the field to `ExecutionContextSchema` so it survives Zod parsing.
  3. Adds an `org_user_ids` field to the RLS compiler's user context.
  4. Adds a new `sys_user_org_members` policy (`id IN (current_user.org_user_ids)`)
     to both `member_default` and `viewer_readonly` permission sets, alongside
     the existing `sys_user_self` policy. The RLS compiler OR-combines them, so
     users see themselves AND their org collaborators.

  Capped at 1000 members per request. Large enterprises should plug in a
  directory cache or split per workspace.

### Minor Changes

- d3b455f: Add server-side Field-Level Security write enforcement. Client-side
  ObjectForm / inline-grid already hides non-editable fields, but the
  SecurityPlugin middleware previously only enforced FLS on **read**
  (`maskResults` on find/findOne). Insert and update operations could
  target any field — a hand-crafted POST bypassed FLS entirely.

  The middleware now runs `FieldMasker.detectForbiddenWrites` on every
  insert / update payload (single record or bulk array) and throws
  `PermissionDeniedError` (HTTP 403) when the payload references a field
  the caller is not permitted to edit. The offending field list is
  exposed via `details.forbiddenFields` for actionable client error UI.

  Allow-list semantics: only fields explicitly enumerated in a
  permission set's `fields` map are constrained. System operations
  (`ExecutionContext.isSystem`) continue to bypass the check.

  Why throw vs. silently stripping: silent strip hides the boundary
  from honest clients (partial-save confusion) AND gives probing clients
  no signal that the field exists. Throwing makes the boundary
  observable in both directions.

  Also exposes `FieldMasker.detectForbiddenWrites(data, fieldPermissions)`
  as a standalone helper for callers that want to do the check
  out-of-band (e.g., adapters that strip-then-warn instead of fail-closed).
