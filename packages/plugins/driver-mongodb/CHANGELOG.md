### Minor Changes

- d1557d9: feat(driver-mongodb)!: declare the driver single-tenant and refuse to boot multi-tenant (#3724)

  `MongoDBDriver` implements **no row-level tenant isolation** — it never reads
  `DriverOptions.tenantId`, so reads carry no tenant predicate and writes are not
  stamped with a tenant column. The layer the SQL driver has (`resolveTenantField`

  - `applyTenantScope`) simply does not exist here, while everything above the
    driver — object metadata's `tenancy` block, `applySystemFields` injecting
    `organization_id`, the engine threading `tenantId` into every driver call —
    operates on the assumption that tenant isolation is a platform guarantee. Point
    a multi-tenant deployment's datasource at Mongo and every query read, updated
    and deleted other tenants' documents, silently.

  Rather than serve unisolated, the driver now fails fast at startup:

  - The **constructor** and `connect()` call `assertSingleTenantPosture()`, which
    refuses any tenancy posture other than `single` (`OS_TENANCY_POSTURE=group` /
    `isolated`, including the posture derived from `OS_MULTI_ORG_ENABLED=true`),
    resolved through the shared `resolveTenancyPosture()` so the driver can never
    disagree with auth / the registry / the CLI about the mode. The check sits in
    the constructor because that is the earliest seam — it fails before a host can
    hand the driver anywhere — and `connect()` re-checks in case a host flips the
    posture in between. (It originally had to live in the constructor because
    `ObjectQLEngine.init()` _caught_ a driver's connect rejection and booted
    anyway; that is fixed in the same release, #3741, so both seams abort boot.)
  - `syncSchema()` / `syncSchemasBatch()` call `assertObjectsNotTenantScoped()` and
    refuse objects declaring `tenancy.enabled: true`, naming every offender in one
    message.
  - `objectstack serve` / `dev` (CLI) now re-throw this error out of the
    auto-driver-registration block instead of swallowing it, so boot exits 1 with
    the actionable message — the same treatment `UnsupportedDriverError` already
    gets. Matched duck-typed by `code`, so the CLI takes no dependency on the
    driver package.

  Both throw `MongoDBMultiTenantUnsupportedError` with
  `code === 'MONGODB_MULTI_TENANT_UNSUPPORTED'`, a message that names the detected
  signal, the remedy, and `@objectstack/driver-sql` as the multi-tenant option.

  There is deliberately **no override env var**: an escape hatch would restore
  exactly the silent non-isolation this guard removes. Single-tenant deployments —
  every currently-working Mongo deployment — are unaffected.

  This is option B of #3724. Implementing real row-level isolation (option A)
  remains open; the `unique` index shape stays single-field until then, which is
  now correct by construction rather than by omission.

- b90086a: fix(driver-sql)!: `unique` materializes per tenant, ending its contradiction with the per-tenant autonumber sequence (#3696)

  `unique: true` became a **single-column global index that ignored `tenancy`
  entirely**, while the autonumber sequence table is keyed by
  `(object, tenant_id, field, scope)` and hands every tenant its own counter
  starting at 1. Two subsystems of the same platform contradicted each other:
  tenant B's `PROD-00001` was rejected by an index it could not see — **no user
  did anything wrong**, the platform's left hand refused what its right hand
  issued.

  The rejection also doubled as a **cross-tenant existence oracle**: a UNIQUE
  violation told tenant B that some _other_ tenant held the value, enumerable by
  probing emails / codes / names.

  **The contract now:**

  | Declaration                      | Materializes as                                                 |
  | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `unique: true` + tenant column   | composite `(tenantField, field)` — unique **within** the tenant |
  | `unique: true`, no tenant column | single-column — single-tenant DDL is byte-identical to before   |
  | `unique: 'global'`               | single-column, always platform-wide                             |

  The tenant column comes first in the composite, so the index also serves the
  `WHERE tenant = ?` prefix scans every tenant-scoped read issues.

  **Declared `indexes[]` are deliberately unchanged.** They are materialized over
  exactly the columns listed — no tenant column is injected. The author already
  spells them out, per-tenant ones have always been written explicitly
  (`fields: ['organization_id', 'code']`), and many are legitimately platform-wide
  (a DNS hostname, a reserved slug, an external provider id). `'global'` is
  accepted there as a synonym of `true` so one vocabulary covers both spellings.

  **Migration is automatic and cannot fail.** Legacy indexes
  (`<table>_<col>_unique` from knex, `uniq_<table>_<col>` from the drift-rebuild
  path) are retired inline at schema-sync time. The old global constraint is
  strictly stronger than the new per-tenant one, so existing rows satisfy the
  replacement by construction — no dedup, no cleanup, no data touched. It
  converges at sync rather than waiting for a deliberate `os migrate` run because
  a deployment that never ran migrate would otherwise stay broken.

  **Upgrading — audit your `unique: true` fields.** On a tenant-scoped object the
  constraint is now per tenant. Anything that must stay platform-wide has to say
  so:

  ```ts
  hostname: Field.text({ unique: "global" }); // no two tenants may claim it
  ```

  Note the reach: `applySystemFields` injects `organization_id` into every
  registered object unless it opts out, and the driver falls back to that column
  when no `tenancy.tenantField` is declared — so most objects are tenant-scoped.
  Typical candidates for `'global'`: DNS hostnames, reserved slugs, external
  provider ids (Stripe customer/subscription), device identities.

  Postgres materializes `col.unique()` as a table CONSTRAINT rather than a bare
  index, so the retirement tries `DROP CONSTRAINT` before `DROP INDEX` —
  `DROP INDEX` alone would have made the migration a no-op on exactly the
  deployments that matter most.

  `@objectstack/driver-mongodb` accepts the new declaration but keeps single-field
  indexes: it implements no row-level tenancy at all (no tenant predicate on read,
  no tenant stamp on write), so a `(tenant, field)` index would advertise an
  isolation it does not deliver. Tracked separately.

### Patch Changes

- 030125b: feat(objectql)!: `init()` refuses to boot when a data driver fails to connect (#3741)

  `ObjectQLEngine.init()` wrapped every driver's `connect()` in a try/catch, logged
  one error line, and carried on. A server whose database was unreachable therefore
  "started successfully" — health endpoints could even stay green — and then failed
  every request with an error that reads nothing like _the database is down_. The
  warning it printed (`Operations may recover via lazy reconnection or fail at query
time`) was half fiction: grep the repo and no reconnection exists in `driver-sql`
  or `driver-mongodb`, so only the "fail at query time" half was ever real. The
  caller made it worse — `ObjectQLPlugin.start()` runs `syncRegisteredSchemas()`
  immediately after `init()`, issuing DDL against a driver that isn't there.

  The structural half of the bug was worse than the operational one: the catch
  removed a driver's ability to **refuse startup at all**. Any fatal startup check —
  licence, server version, incompatible configuration, missing capability, not just
  an unreachable socket — is expressed by throwing from `connect()`, and every one
  of them was silently downgraded to a runtime error. That is why driver-mongodb's
  multi-tenancy guard (#3724 / #3734) had to be hoisted into its constructor.

  - `init()` now **throws** `DriverConnectError` (`code: 'ERR_DRIVER_CONNECT'`)
    when any boot-registered driver's `connect()` rejects, aborting kernel
    bootstrap. It still attempts every driver first, so one failed boot names all
    of them. The message is self-contained — each failed driver and its cause —
    because the CLI prints `error.message` alone; the first cause is also attached
    as `error.cause`. Exported from both `@objectstack/objectql` and
    `@objectstack/objectql/core`.
  - `connect()` is now a supported place for a driver to veto boot. Startup
    validation that needs a live connection (server version, capability probes)
    no longer has to be forced into a constructor.
  - The misleading "lazy reconnection" warning is gone.
  - New escape hatch `OS_ALLOW_DRIVER_CONNECT_FAILURE=1`
    (`resolveAllowDriverConnectFailure()` in `@objectstack/types`) restores the old
    lenient boot, but loudly: a `DEGRADED BOOT` banner names the failed drivers and
    states that they are never retried or reconnected and that every query and
    schema sync routed to them will fail for the process lifetime. The banner goes
    to stderr as well as the logger, because `os serve` swallows all of stdout
    during boot and `Logger` routes `warn` there — logger-only, the one message
    that matters would be invisible in exactly the deployment the flag is for.
    Defaults off.

  **Migration.** No code or config change is needed for a correctly configured
  deployment — a driver that connected before still connects. A deployment that was
  _silently_ booting without its database now fails the boot instead, with the
  driver name and cause in the error; fix the datasource configuration (typically
  `OS_DATABASE_URL`, credentials, or network reachability). To keep booting without
  it — deliberately, and knowing every request that touches it will fail — set
  `OS_ALLOW_DRIVER_CONNECT_FAILURE=1`.

### Minor Changes

- d980f0d: feat: add a first-class `user` field type (person picker)

  A new `user` field type — the equivalent of Airtable's Collaborator / Notion's
  Person / Salesforce's `Lookup(User)`. Authored as `Field.user({ ... })`; use
  `{ multiple: true }` for collaborators/watchers and `{ defaultValue: 'current_user' }`
  to auto-fill the acting user on create.

  **Why a distinct type rather than telling authors to `Field.lookup('sys_user')`:**
  selecting a person is table-stakes, but the value is in _modelling
  discoverability_ — a "User" entry in the Studio/AI field palette instead of
  requiring authors (and AI) to know to reference the internal `sys_user` system
  object — plus `current_user` defaults and a user-search picker. Storage and
  runtime are unchanged.

  **Deliberately NOT a new storage primitive.** `user` is a _semantic
  specialization of `lookup`_ with the target fixed to `sys_user`: it shares the
  exact lookup code path — same FK string column (`multiple` ⇒ JSON), same
  `$expand` resolution, same indexing — so referential integrity and fresh display
  names come for free, and nothing is re-implemented. An existing
  `Field.lookup('sys_user')` is therefore equivalent at the storage layer (zero
  data migration to adopt `Field.user`).

  Ownership semantics are **unchanged**: the existing `owner_id` convention +
  `plugin-security` auto-stamp/RLS still apply. A declarative `owner` flag is a
  possible future follow-up; intentionally not added here to avoid a second
  field type for what is a system role (rationale: keep the `FieldType` surface
  lean — see related ADR-0059 freeze discipline).

  Changes: `FieldType` gains `'user'` + `Field.user()` builder; the SQL/Mongo
  drivers treat `user` exactly like `lookup`; the engine resolves `$expand` for
  `user` fields and honours a new `defaultValue: 'current_user'` token (resolved
  app-side from the execution context, mirroring the `NOW()` convention); kanban
  group-by and symbolic seed references accept `user`; approvals enrich `user`
  references. The public API surface is unchanged (additive enum member).

### Patch Changes

- 1e8b680: fix(security): close four P0 launch-readiness findings

  - **plugin-auth (P0-1):** `generateSecret()` now throws (fails boot) when no
    `OS_AUTH_SECRET` is set and `NODE_ENV==='production'`, instead of silently
    falling back to a predictable `dev-secret-<timestamp>` (session forgery). The
    dev/test fallback is unchanged.
  - **plugin-security (P0-2):** the permission-resolution `catch` now **fails
    closed** — it logs at ERROR and throws `PermissionDeniedError` rather than
    `return next()`. A degraded metadata service can no longer let every
    authenticated request bypass RBAC/RLS. System operations still bypass as before.
  - **driver-sql (P0-3):** the `contains` / `$contains` operator now escapes LIKE
    metacharacters (`%` / `_` / `\`) in the user value and binds an explicit
    `ESCAPE '\'`, so a value of `%` matches literally instead of every row
    (filter bypass). Correct across SQLite/MySQL/Postgres.
  - **driver-mongodb (P0-4):** the field-operator translator now rejects unknown
    `$`-operators instead of passing them through, blocking `$where` / `$function`
    / `$expr` (server-side JS execution / query-intent bypass). All legitimate
    ObjectQL operators remain allowlisted.

  +12 regression tests across the four packages.
