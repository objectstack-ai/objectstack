### Patch Changes

- b3a2318: fix(driver-memory,driver-mongodb): a bare-day upper bound covers the whole day (#4042)

  The non-SQL half of #3777's calendar-day rule. Both drivers compiled a bare
  `YYYY-MM-DD` `$lte` (and a `between` max) as-is, so on timestamp values the
  window cut off at the final day's midnight — the dashboard date-range filter's
  default configuration (`created_at`, 7 of 13 presets ending "today") lost the
  current day, exactly as it did on SQL before #3777 was fixed.

  Both drivers now compile a bare-day upper bound half-open, sharing
  `nextUtcCalendarDay` from `@objectstack/core`:

  - `driver-memory`: the Mongo-style and array `where` spellings in the mingo
    lowering (`$lte`/`<=` → `$lt` next day; `$between`/`between` max the same),
    the analytics cube-filter `lte`, and the analytics `dateRange` window — which
    now also matches BOTH stored forms of a timestamp (ISO strings and `Date`
    objects) instead of only `Date`s, since mingo compares cross-type as
    never-equal.
  - `driver-mongodb`: the `translateFilter` lowering, all three spellings
    (`$lte`, `$between`, array `<=`/`lte`).

  Unchanged on purpose, matching the #3777 semantics table: full-ISO/`Date`
  comparands keep instant semantics, and `$gte`/`$gt`/`$lt` keep their midnight
  anchoring. Known remaining gap (tracked separately): values stored as BSON
  `Date` (mongodb) or JS `Date` (memory `find()`) never match _string_ comparands
  of any operator — a storage-form problem, not a bound-semantics one.

- 2e836de: chore(packaging): CHANGELOG.md ships in every npm tarball (#4261)

  The AGENTS.md post-task checklist requires breaking changesets to carry their
  FROM → TO migration because "this text ships to consumers as `CHANGELOG.md`
  inside the npm package and is what an upgrading agent greps after the tombstone
  error." That delivery path was severed for 68 of the 69 publishable packages:
  npm packs `package.json` / `README*` / `LICENSE*` unconditionally but — unlike
  older npm versions — not `CHANGELOG.md`, and the canonical
  `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]` whitelist never named it. Measured on npm
  10.9.7: `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/types` shipped 3 files while its
  70KB `CHANGELOG.md` stayed behind. Only `@objectstack/spec` listed it
  explicitly.

  The tombstone-error scenario is precisely the one where the repo is out of
  reach — the upgrading agent has `node_modules` and nothing else — so the
  migration text has to ride in the tarball. Every publishable package now
  declares `CHANGELOG.md` in `files`, and the canonical whitelist is
  `["dist", "README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]`.

  The other half is the gate: `check:published-files` gains a fifth invariant,
  COMPLETE — a whitelist that fails to cover `CHANGELOG.md` fails the
  always-required lint job, so the next package cannot silently sever the path
  again. `@objectstack/spec`'s per-package EXTRA_ENTRIES exemption dissolves
  into the canonical set.

  Consumer-visible change: one more file per install (the package's changelog,
  e.g. 70.8KB for `@objectstack/types`), and `grep -r "removed key"
node_modules/@objectstack/*/CHANGELOG.md` now finds the migration it was
  promised.

- 9e8f04d: fix(driver-memory,driver-mongodb): `Field.datetime` has one storage form per driver (#4047)

  The non-SQL counterpart of ADR-0053 D-B (#3912). Both drivers let the writer
  decide a datetime value's runtime type, and both compare across types by type
  bracket rather than by value — so a string comparand never matched a `Date`
  value, in either direction, for **every** operator including `$gte`.

  A datetime column genuinely held both forms: the drivers' own
  `created_at`/`updated_at` defaults bind a `Date` (mongo) or an ISO string
  (memory), while REST/JSON writes, relative-date tokens and `initialData`
  fixtures supply the other. A dashboard date window therefore answered with
  whichever half happened to match the comparand's type — on MongoDB, where
  `created_at` is a BSON `Date` and dashboard bounds are strings, that meant
  **no rows at all**, which is worse than the final-day loss #3777 fixed.

  Each driver now has one canonical form, applied on write and to every filter
  comparand:

  | Driver           | `datetime`                                                                                                           | `date`            |
  | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
  | `driver-mongodb` | BSON `Date` — the dialect's native instant, its `timestamptz`                                                        | `YYYY-MM-DD` text |
  | `driver-memory`  | canonical UTC ISO text (sorts chronologically under the string comparison mingo performs; survives JSON persistence) | `YYYY-MM-DD` text |

  Both learn their temporal fields from `syncSchema`, so an object that was never
  declared is left exactly as written — the drivers do not guess types from
  values. `driver-memory` additionally converges rows already in the table when
  the schema arrives, which catches `initialData` fixtures and anything a
  persistence adapter restored (the in-memory analogue of
  `backfillCanonicalDatetimes`, and idempotent like it).

  `Field.date` deliberately stays timezone-naive text on both — converting it to
  an instant would invent a midnight and re-couple it to a zone. The
  calendar-day bound semantics from #3777/#4042 are unchanged and now compose
  with the converged storage: the whole-day rewrite runs on the calendar string
  first, and only the resulting bound is converted to the storage form.

- e59786e: fix(spec): five exported symbols resolved to `any` — type the recursive schemas and gate it in CI (#4171)

  A recursive Zod schema needs an explicit annotation to break its circular
  inference, and five of them took the cheapest one available:

  ```ts
  export const NavigationItemSchema: z.ZodType<any> = z.lazy(() => …);
  export type NavigationItem = z.infer<typeof NavigationItemSchema>;   // → any
  ```

  It compiles, it validates correctly at runtime, and it silently throws the type
  away. `NavigationItem`, `FormField`, `JoinNode` and `NormalizedFilter` were all
  `any` on the published surface, plus `FieldNodeSchema` — which had no exported
  type alias yet, so `z.infer<typeof FieldNodeSchema>` was `any` and
  `QueryAST['fields']` with it.

  That is worse than a missing export. #4115 tells every consumer that a local
  declaration under a spec export's name must be replaced by a binding to the
  spec — and for these, obeying it **replaced a precise type with `any`**.
  objectui's `NavigationItem` is a 118-line documented interface (`recordId`
  template variables, `requiresObject` / `requiresService` capability gates,
  `filters` precedence); every key of it exists in the spec's version, so by every
  available signal it read as a redundant fork safe to delete. Deleting it swapped
  a fully-typed interface for `any`, with no compile error anywhere to say so.

  It is hard to catch by inspection because `any` is mutually assignable with
  everything, so the natural "are these the same type?" check answers _yes_ in both
  directions and recommends precisely the wrong action. Same failure family as
  #4075's `[key: string]: any` on `ActionDef`: a type that agrees with everything
  reads as agreement.

  **Now annotated with the real type**, using the pattern `QueryAST` already
  follows in `data/query.zod.ts` — infer the non-recursive part, tie the recursive
  knot in the type, so the keys stay derived from the schema instead of being
  hand-maintained beside it:

  ```ts
  const BaseXSchema = z.object({ …every non-recursive key });
  export type X = z.infer<typeof BaseXSchema> & { children?: X[] };
  export const XSchema: z.ZodType<X> = z.lazy(() => BaseXSchema.extend({
    children: z.array(XSchema).optional(),
  }));
  ```

  `z.infer` now resolves to the type it should always have been: `NavigationItem`
  is the nine-branch discriminated union, `FormField` the 30-key form-field
  contract (with `visibleOn` absent by construction — ADR-0089 D2 folds it into
  `visibleWhen` at the boundary), `JoinNode` and the newly exported `FieldNode`
  the query AST nodes, `NormalizedFilter` the normalized filter AST. Runtime
  validation is unchanged: every schema parses exactly what it parsed before.

  **What the types immediately caught**, none of it visible while they were `any`:

  - `account.app.ts` set `defaultOpen` on three nav groups — a key the spec has
    never declared. It worked only because objectui's `NavigationRenderer` still
    falls back to that legacy alias. Fixed at the producer per Prime Directive
    #12: the canonical key is `expanded`.
  - The MongoDB driver built its projection with `projection[field] = 1` over
    `query.fields`, so a relationship `FieldNode` would have keyed the projection
    on `"[object Object]"`. It now reads the node's field name.
  - `setup.app.ts`, `studio.app.ts` and `setup-nav.contributions.ts` are annotated
    with the PARSED `App` / `NavigationContribution` types but omitted
    `.default()`ed keys (`expanded`, `target`), as did the form fields
    `metadata-protocol` synthesizes for `getUiView` (`span`). Each now states the
    default it was relying on, matching what the surrounding literals already do
    for `active` / `isDefault` / `collapsible` / `collapsed` / `columns`.

  **Gated, not just fixed** (`check:exported-any`, wired into the required
  `TypeScript Type Check` job). `api-surface.json` records that an export _exists_
  and never what it _resolves to_, which is how these survived a whole major with
  every gate green. The new scan reads the built `.d.ts` a consumer's import
  actually resolves to and fails on any exported type that resolves to `any` — or
  any exported schema whose output is `any`, the root cause, and the only reason
  `FieldNodeSchema` was visible at all. Its `KNOWN_ANY` ledger is shrink-only and
  currently empty. It self-tests against the real zod first, so if the internals it
  reads are ever renamed the gate fails loudly instead of quietly passing
  everything forever.

- a13827e: fix(data): paging a sorted read is a partition of the result set, not five queries that share a WHERE clause (objectui#3106)

  `ORDER BY status LIMIT 50 OFFSET 50` names a sort key that does not identify a
  row, and no backend promises that rows with equal keys keep the same relative
  arrangement between two queries. MongoDB documents this outright — `sort` +
  `skip`/`limit` on a non-unique key "may return the same document more than
  once". So page 2 could repeat a row page 1 already showed and skip one nobody
  ever saw:

  ```
  page 1: ORDER BY status LIMIT 5 OFFSET 0   -> [r05 r07 r11 r04 …]
  page 2: ORDER BY status LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5   -> [r04 …]        r04 again; one row never served
  ```

  Every page is full, every row is real and belongs, and the duplicate sits
  several screens from the omission — which is why this is found by a user
  counting records, never by reading a response.

  `SqlDriver` and `MongoDBDriver` now append a unique tie-breaker to any non-empty
  `orderBy`, in the last requested key's direction (determinism holds either way,
  but a same-direction suffix is the one an index can still walk in one pass).
  `driver-memory` already conformed — `Array#sort` is stable over a table whose
  order does not move — and now has a suite saying so, because that property is
  implicit and easy to lose in a refactor that looks like a speed-up.

  `SqlDriver` adds it only for objects it created itself (`initObjects` records
  those). A federated table (ADR-0015) may have no `id` column, and guessing there
  would be worse than doing nothing: the unknown-column error is answered by
  #3821's ladder retrying with **no ORDER BY at all**, trading a reshuffle among
  ties for the loss of the caller's whole sort.

  The obligation is now normative on `IDataDriver.find`, with shared cases in
  `@objectstack/spec/data` (`PAGINATION_CASES`) that all three drivers run — so a
  future driver is held to it by a gate rather than by remembering.

  Not covered by this change: a paged read with **no** `orderBy`. Same defect,
  wider blast radius, so it was carved out to #4363 rather than folded in — and
  closed there, in the same release. The contract, the shared cases and both
  drivers now cover a paged read whatever its `orderBy`, including none at all.

- 8675db6: refactor(data)!: a select-list entry is a field name — the nested-select object form is removed (#4196)

  `FieldNode` declared two forms for one entry of `QueryAST['fields']`:

  ```ts
  type FieldNode =
    | string // "name"
    | { field: string; fields?: FieldNode[]; alias?: string }; // nested select
  ```

  The object form was **declared-but-inert**. Nothing produced it, and nothing
  read `.fields` or `.alias` — every consumer on the path treats the list as
  `string[]`: `objectql`'s formula projection and its two known-field filters,
  `driver-sql`'s `select()`, `driver-memory`'s `projectFields`. `driver-mongodb`
  keyed its projection with the entry itself, so an object entry asked for a
  column literally named `"[object Object]"`, and the REST ingress stringified
  each entry before comparing it to the field map, so the same entry came back as
  `400 INVALID_FIELD: Unknown field '[object Object]'` — a rejection naming
  something the caller never wrote. An author who wrote
  `fields: [{ field: 'owner', fields: ['name'] }]` got it accepted by validation
  and then dropped or mangled, depending on the driver (ADR-0078 silently-inert
  declaration; ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).

  The capability the object form described is already served, by a different key.
  Removing the second spelling rather than lowering it into the first is Prime
  Directive #12: one capability, one contract.

  **FROM → TO**

  | Was                                                               | Now                                                              |
  | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `fields: [{ field: 'owner', fields: ['name'] }]`                  | `expand: { owner: { object: 'user', fields: ['name'] } }`        |
  | `fields: [{ field: 'owner' }]`                                    | `fields: ['owner']`                                              |
  | `fields: [{ field: 'owner', fields: ['name'] }]`, one column only | `fields: ['owner.name']` (dotted path)                           |
  | `fields: [{ field: 'total', alias: 't' }]`                        | `aggregations` / `windowFunctions` — they carry the live `alias` |

  The one-line fix: **a `fields[]` entry is a string.** Move nested selection to
  `expand`, which the engine resolves through batch `$in` queries (default max
  depth 3).

  There is no `os migrate meta` step, and deliberately so: `QueryAST` is a request
  shape, never stored in stack metadata, so the chain has no source to rewrite. It
  is registered as an ADR-0087 D3 **semantic** migration
  (`query-field-node-object-form-retired`) on the protocol-17 step instead — the
  `EnhancedApiError.fieldErrors` / `BatchOptions.validateOnly` precedent. Callers
  move their own select lists, and both channels tell them how:

  - **The parse.** `FieldNodeSchema` narrows to `z.string()` with an error map that
    answers an object entry with the prescription above, not "expected string,
    received object". `z.input` becomes `string`, so `tsc` fails at the authoring
    site first.
  - **The ingress.** `assertProjectionFieldsExist` judges the entry's _shape_
    before consulting the object's field map — it is wrong about the shape, not
    about this object, and a registry-less host would otherwise pass it to a driver
    that cannot read it. The 400 now names the retired form instead of the field
    `"[object Object]"`.

  No runtime behaviour changes for anything that ever worked; the defensive
  unwrapping the drivers had grown against a shape nothing sends goes with it.

- 6038de7: feat(spec,drivers): the temporal conformance matrix gains its `Field.time` axis — and `time` finally gets a storage form off SQL (ADR-0053 D-A3.2)

  `@objectstack/spec/data` gains `TEMPORAL_TIME_ROWS` / `TEMPORAL_TIME_CASES`,
  the wall-clock half of the shared matrix. A time gets its own table rather than
  a third `kind` on the existing one because it shares no comparand vocabulary
  with the other two: no relative token resolves to a wall clock, and the
  bare-day whole-day rule (#3777) must **not** reach it — which the table now
  asserts rather than assumes, since "the rule leaked into the wrong field type"
  is exactly what a conformance matrix is for. The fixture is a business day
  carrying the boundaries #3994 measured: both window edges, the pair straddling
  the millisecond-suffix width change, midnight and `23:59:59.999`.

  **The axis found a real gap on its first run.** ADR-0053 D-C gave `Field.time`
  a canonical form on every SQL dialect, but `driver-memory` and
  `driver-mongodb` were never extended — both declared
  `TemporalFieldKind = 'datetime' | 'date'`, so a `time` column was never
  classified and never coerced. It therefore held whatever each writer produced,
  and both stores compare across types by bracket: a text bound matched no
  `Date`-written row, in either direction, for every operator. Measured on
  `driver-memory`, **8 of the 9 shared cases** returned only the text-written
  half — a business-hours window answering `[d_mid, f_close]` instead of
  `[c_open, d_mid, e_mid_ms, f_close]`. This is #4047's failure one field type
  over, and it survived #4047 because that work extended `datetime` and `date`
  without revisiting `time`. On mongo it was also a documentation failure: that
  module's canon table has listed `time` as `HH:MM:SS[.fff]` text since #3994,
  and nothing implemented it.

  Both drivers now carry `storageTimeValue`, mirroring the SQL
  `canonicalTimeOfDay`: `HH:MM:SS`, `.fff` only when the milliseconds are
  non-zero, a `Date` / epoch / full-timestamp folding to its **UTC** time-of-day
  (never the host's), and totality — an out-of-range wall clock like `'25:00'`
  passes through rather than being silently rewritten. Text on both, mongo
  included: a wall clock is not an instant, so a BSON `Date` would invent a
  calendar day and a zone the author never wrote.

  If you have existing `time` data on either driver, values written as `Date`
  objects converge to canonical text on their next write; reads of un-migrated
  documents are unchanged. Filters were already unable to reach the mixed half,
  so no query that worked before stops working.

- 8b50cb3: fix(data): a paged read with no `orderBy` is a partition too — the shape every list view actually sends (#4363)

  objectui#3106's server half closed the **sorted** paged read: a non-empty
  `orderBy` now carries a unique tie-breaker, so `ORDER BY status LIMIT 50 OFFSET
50` can no longer serve one row twice while never serving another. It stopped
  there deliberately. This closes the half it left, which is the more common one.

  A list view whose metadata configures no `sort`, on which nobody has clicked a
  column header, sends no `$orderby` at all. `SqlDriver` and `MongoDBDriver` then
  emitted a bare `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` — and neither backend promises anything about
  the order that slices:

  - **SQL** leaves the row order of an unordered read to the plan. Small tables
    hand back insertion order in practice, which is exactly why this survives
    testing; a parallel scan, an index scan, or a `VACUUM` need not.
  - **MongoDB** returns natural order, which describes where a document currently
    sits in its extent — and moves when the document does.

  Every row ties with every other on an empty sort key, so this is the same defect
  at full strength rather than a different one: page 2 repeats a row page 1 showed
  and drops one nobody sees, with every page full and every row real.

  Both drivers now order a paged read by their unique key column when the caller
  supplied no sort keys — the same `id` the tie-breaker was already appending, now
  standing alone. `driver-memory` again needed no change: it slices its backing
  array, and two reads with no write between them see the identical sequence. The
  contract asks for a partition, not for id order.

  **Unpaged reads are untouched, deliberately.** The rule keys off `limit`/
  `offset`, not off `orderBy` being absent. A read with neither hands back the
  whole matching set, so no caller can be shown a partial view of it, and sorting
  every read in the system would change plan selection to buy nothing. `limit`
  alone does count as paged: page one of a walk is routinely `limit=50` with no
  offset, and ordering only the later pages would leave the defect fully intact.

  `SqlDriver` keeps the existing restriction to objects it created itself
  (`initObjects` records them). It matters more here than for the sorted case: on
  a federated table (ADR-0015) there is no requested sort for #3821's ladder to
  fall back to, so a wrong guess about `id` would turn a reshuffle into a failed
  read. Those tables now get a warning — once per object, behavior unchanged —
  because the contract states determinism as a MUST, and a MUST that quietly does
  not hold is the same invisible failure the rule was written against.

  `findOne` is deliberately outside all of this, and the contract now says so.
  Engines reach a driver with `limit: 1`, which is shaped exactly like page one of
  a walk, but it promises _a_ matching record rather than a position in a
  sequence — nothing for a second call to be inconsistent with. Reading it as a
  page would put `ORDER BY id LIMIT 1` on the hottest read in the system, which is
  the classic shape for a planner to abandon the predicate's own index: measured
  on Postgres 16 over 2M rows, `WHERE owner_id = ? LIMIT 1` went 0.08 ms → 7.8 ms
  and swapped the `owner_id` index for the primary key. `MongoDBDriver.findOne`
  has never sorted, so this also puts the two drivers back in step.

  The obligation is normative on `IDataDriver.find` and the cases are shared —
  `PAGINATION_UNORDERED_CASES` alongside `PAGINATION_CASES` in
  `@objectstack/spec/data` — so a future driver is held to both halves by a gate
  rather than by remembering.

### Minor Changes

- d1557d9: feat(driver-mongodb)!: declare the driver single-tenant and refuse to boot multi-tenant (#3724)

  `MongoDBDriver` implements **no row-level tenant isolation** — it never reads
  `DriverOptions.tenantId`, so reads carry no tenant predicate and writes are not
  stamped with a tenant column. The layer the SQL driver has (`resolveTenantField`

  - `applyTenantScope`) simply does not exist here, while everything above the
    driver — object metadata's `tenancy` block, `applySystemFields` injecting
    `organization_id`, the engine threading `tenantId` into every driver call —
    operates on the assumption that tenant isolation is a platform guarantee. Point
    a multi-tenant deployment's datasource at Mongo and every query read, updated
    and deleted other tenants' documents, silently.

  Rather than serve unisolated, the driver now fails fast at startup:

  - The **constructor** and `connect()` call `assertSingleTenantPosture()`, which
    refuses any tenancy posture other than `single` (`OS_TENANCY_POSTURE=group` /
    `isolated`, including the posture derived from `OS_MULTI_ORG_ENABLED=true`),
    resolved through the shared `resolveTenancyPosture()` so the driver can never
    disagree with auth / the registry / the CLI about the mode. The check sits in
    the constructor because that is the earliest seam — it fails before a host can
    hand the driver anywhere — and `connect()` re-checks in case a host flips the
    posture in between. (It originally had to live in the constructor because
    `ObjectQLEngine.init()` _caught_ a driver's connect rejection and booted
    anyway; that is fixed in the same release, #3741, so both seams abort boot.)
  - `syncSchema()` / `syncSchemasBatch()` call `assertObjectsNotTenantScoped()` and
    refuse objects declaring `tenancy.enabled: true`, naming every offender in one
    message.
  - `objectstack serve` / `dev` (CLI) now re-throw this error out of the
    auto-driver-registration block instead of swallowing it, so boot exits 1 with
    the actionable message — the same treatment `UnsupportedDriverError` already
    gets. Matched duck-typed by `code`, so the CLI takes no dependency on the
    driver package.

  Both throw `MongoDBMultiTenantUnsupportedError` with
  `code === 'MONGODB_MULTI_TENANT_UNSUPPORTED'`, a message that names the detected
  signal, the remedy, and `@objectstack/driver-sql` as the multi-tenant option.

  There is deliberately **no override env var**: an escape hatch would restore
  exactly the silent non-isolation this guard removes. Single-tenant deployments —
  every currently-working Mongo deployment — are unaffected.

  This is option B of #3724. Implementing real row-level isolation (option A)
  remains open; the `unique` index shape stays single-field until then, which is
  now correct by construction rather than by omission.

- b90086a: fix(driver-sql)!: `unique` materializes per tenant, ending its contradiction with the per-tenant autonumber sequence (#3696)

  `unique: true` became a **single-column global index that ignored `tenancy`
  entirely**, while the autonumber sequence table is keyed by
  `(object, tenant_id, field, scope)` and hands every tenant its own counter
  starting at 1. Two subsystems of the same platform contradicted each other:
  tenant B's `PROD-00001` was rejected by an index it could not see — **no user
  did anything wrong**, the platform's left hand refused what its right hand
  issued.

  The rejection also doubled as a **cross-tenant existence oracle**: a UNIQUE
  violation told tenant B that some _other_ tenant held the value, enumerable by
  probing emails / codes / names.

  **The contract now:**

  | Declaration                      | Materializes as                                                 |
  | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `unique: true` + tenant column   | composite `(tenantField, field)` — unique **within** the tenant |
  | `unique: true`, no tenant column | single-column — single-tenant DDL is byte-identical to before   |
  | `unique: 'global'`               | single-column, always platform-wide                             |

  The tenant column comes first in the composite, so the index also serves the
  `WHERE tenant = ?` prefix scans every tenant-scoped read issues.

  **Declared `indexes[]` are deliberately unchanged.** They are materialized over
  exactly the columns listed — no tenant column is injected. The author already
  spells them out, per-tenant ones have always been written explicitly
  (`fields: ['organization_id', 'code']`), and many are legitimately platform-wide
  (a DNS hostname, a reserved slug, an external provider id). `'global'` is
  accepted there as a synonym of `true` so one vocabulary covers both spellings.

  **Migration is automatic and cannot fail.** Legacy indexes
  (`<table>_<col>_unique` from knex, `uniq_<table>_<col>` from the drift-rebuild
  path) are retired inline at schema-sync time. The old global constraint is
  strictly stronger than the new per-tenant one, so existing rows satisfy the
  replacement by construction — no dedup, no cleanup, no data touched. It
  converges at sync rather than waiting for a deliberate `os migrate` run because
  a deployment that never ran migrate would otherwise stay broken.

  **Upgrading — audit your `unique: true` fields.** On a tenant-scoped object the
  constraint is now per tenant. Anything that must stay platform-wide has to say
  so:

  ```ts
  hostname: Field.text({ unique: "global" }); // no two tenants may claim it
  ```

  Note the reach: `applySystemFields` injects `organization_id` into every
  registered object unless it opts out, and the driver falls back to that column
  when no `tenancy.tenantField` is declared — so most objects are tenant-scoped.
  Typical candidates for `'global'`: DNS hostnames, reserved slugs, external
  provider ids (Stripe customer/subscription), device identities.

  Postgres materializes `col.unique()` as a table CONSTRAINT rather than a bare
  index, so the retirement tries `DROP CONSTRAINT` before `DROP INDEX` —
  `DROP INDEX` alone would have made the migration a no-op on exactly the
  deployments that matter most.

  `@objectstack/driver-mongodb` accepts the new declaration but keeps single-field
  indexes: it implements no row-level tenancy at all (no tenant predicate on read,
  no tenant stamp on write), so a `(tenant, field)` index would advertise an
  isolation it does not deliver. Tracked separately.

### Patch Changes

- 030125b: feat(objectql)!: `init()` refuses to boot when a data driver fails to connect (#3741)

  `ObjectQLEngine.init()` wrapped every driver's `connect()` in a try/catch, logged
  one error line, and carried on. A server whose database was unreachable therefore
  "started successfully" — health endpoints could even stay green — and then failed
  every request with an error that reads nothing like _the database is down_. The
  warning it printed (`Operations may recover via lazy reconnection or fail at query
time`) was half fiction: grep the repo and no reconnection exists in `driver-sql`
  or `driver-mongodb`, so only the "fail at query time" half was ever real. The
  caller made it worse — `ObjectQLPlugin.start()` runs `syncRegisteredSchemas()`
  immediately after `init()`, issuing DDL against a driver that isn't there.

  The structural half of the bug was worse than the operational one: the catch
  removed a driver's ability to **refuse startup at all**. Any fatal startup check —
  licence, server version, incompatible configuration, missing capability, not just
  an unreachable socket — is expressed by throwing from `connect()`, and every one
  of them was silently downgraded to a runtime error. That is why driver-mongodb's
  multi-tenancy guard (#3724 / #3734) had to be hoisted into its constructor.

  - `init()` now **throws** `DriverConnectError` (`code: 'ERR_DRIVER_CONNECT'`)
    when any boot-registered driver's `connect()` rejects, aborting kernel
    bootstrap. It still attempts every driver first, so one failed boot names all
    of them. The message is self-contained — each failed driver and its cause —
    because the CLI prints `error.message` alone; the first cause is also attached
    as `error.cause`. Exported from both `@objectstack/objectql` and
    `@objectstack/objectql/core`.
  - `connect()` is now a supported place for a driver to veto boot. Startup
    validation that needs a live connection (server version, capability probes)
    no longer has to be forced into a constructor.
  - The misleading "lazy reconnection" warning is gone.
  - New escape hatch `OS_ALLOW_DRIVER_CONNECT_FAILURE=1`
    (`resolveAllowDriverConnectFailure()` in `@objectstack/types`) restores the old
    lenient boot, but loudly: a `DEGRADED BOOT` banner names the failed drivers and
    states that they are never retried or reconnected and that every query and
    schema sync routed to them will fail for the process lifetime. The banner goes
    to stderr as well as the logger, because `os serve` swallows all of stdout
    during boot and `Logger` routes `warn` there — logger-only, the one message
    that matters would be invisible in exactly the deployment the flag is for.
    Defaults off.

  **Migration.** No code or config change is needed for a correctly configured
  deployment — a driver that connected before still connects. A deployment that was
  _silently_ booting without its database now fails the boot instead, with the
  driver name and cause in the error; fix the datasource configuration (typically
  `OS_DATABASE_URL`, credentials, or network reachability). To keep booting without
  it — deliberately, and knowing every request that touches it will fail — set
  `OS_ALLOW_DRIVER_CONNECT_FAILURE=1`.

### Minor Changes

- d980f0d: feat: add a first-class `user` field type (person picker)

  A new `user` field type — the equivalent of Airtable's Collaborator / Notion's
  Person / Salesforce's `Lookup(User)`. Authored as `Field.user({ ... })`; use
  `{ multiple: true }` for collaborators/watchers and `{ defaultValue: 'current_user' }`
  to auto-fill the acting user on create.

  **Why a distinct type rather than telling authors to `Field.lookup('sys_user')`:**
  selecting a person is table-stakes, but the value is in _modelling
  discoverability_ — a "User" entry in the Studio/AI field palette instead of
  requiring authors (and AI) to know to reference the internal `sys_user` system
  object — plus `current_user` defaults and a user-search picker. Storage and
  runtime are unchanged.

  **Deliberately NOT a new storage primitive.** `user` is a _semantic
  specialization of `lookup`_ with the target fixed to `sys_user`: it shares the
  exact lookup code path — same FK string column (`multiple` ⇒ JSON), same
  `$expand` resolution, same indexing — so referential integrity and fresh display
  names come for free, and nothing is re-implemented. An existing
  `Field.lookup('sys_user')` is therefore equivalent at the storage layer (zero
  data migration to adopt `Field.user`).

  Ownership semantics are **unchanged**: the existing `owner_id` convention +
  `plugin-security` auto-stamp/RLS still apply. A declarative `owner` flag is a
  possible future follow-up; intentionally not added here to avoid a second
  field type for what is a system role (rationale: keep the `FieldType` surface
  lean — see related ADR-0059 freeze discipline).

  Changes: `FieldType` gains `'user'` + `Field.user()` builder; the SQL/Mongo
  drivers treat `user` exactly like `lookup`; the engine resolves `$expand` for
  `user` fields and honours a new `defaultValue: 'current_user'` token (resolved
  app-side from the execution context, mirroring the `NOW()` convention); kanban
  group-by and symbolic seed references accept `user`; approvals enrich `user`
  references. The public API surface is unchanged (additive enum member).

### Patch Changes

- 1e8b680: fix(security): close four P0 launch-readiness findings

  - **plugin-auth (P0-1):** `generateSecret()` now throws (fails boot) when no
    `OS_AUTH_SECRET` is set and `NODE_ENV==='production'`, instead of silently
    falling back to a predictable `dev-secret-<timestamp>` (session forgery). The
    dev/test fallback is unchanged.
  - **plugin-security (P0-2):** the permission-resolution `catch` now **fails
    closed** — it logs at ERROR and throws `PermissionDeniedError` rather than
    `return next()`. A degraded metadata service can no longer let every
    authenticated request bypass RBAC/RLS. System operations still bypass as before.
  - **driver-sql (P0-3):** the `contains` / `$contains` operator now escapes LIKE
    metacharacters (`%` / `_` / `\`) in the user value and binds an explicit
    `ESCAPE '\'`, so a value of `%` matches literally instead of every row
    (filter bypass). Correct across SQLite/MySQL/Postgres.
  - **driver-mongodb (P0-4):** the field-operator translator now rejects unknown
    `$`-operators instead of passing them through, blocking `$where` / `$function`
    / `$expr` (server-side JS execution / query-intent bypass). All legitimate
    ObjectQL operators remain allowlisted.

  +12 regression tests across the four packages.
