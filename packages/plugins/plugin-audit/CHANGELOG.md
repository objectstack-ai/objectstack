### Patch Changes

- c5e7bd9: fix(plugin-audit): say where the audit system tables were provisioned, and stop skipping provisioning silently (#4887)

  `AuditPlugin.provisionSystemTables()` created `sys_audit_log` / `sys_activity` /
  `sys_comment` at `kernel:ready` and then said **nothing** — not on success, and
  not when it skipped the work entirely (`typeof engine.syncObjectSchema !==
'function'` returned silently). `syncObjectSchema()` itself returns `void` and
  has three silent exits of its own — the object is not in the registry, no driver
  resolves for it, or the resolved driver has no `syncSchema` — none of which
  throw. So "provisioned three tables" and "provisioned nothing at all" produced
  byte-identical logs, and the only way to tell them apart was to go looking in a
  database.

  #4887 is what that costs. `sys_audit_log` and `sys_activity` were reported as
  never provisioned because they were absent from the primary SQLite file, with
  the silent `typeof` bail named as the likely cause. Neither was true:
  `sys_audit_log` (`lifecycle.class: 'audit'`) and `sys_activity`
  (`lifecycle.class: 'telemetry'`) are routed by **ADR-0057 §3.6** to the
  dedicated `telemetry` datasource whenever one is registered, and `os dev`
  registers one by default as a _sibling file_ (`dev.db` → `dev.telemetry.db`).
  Both tables had been created — in the other store. `sys_comment` carries no
  lifecycle class, stays on the primary, and was the one that "existed". Nothing
  in the log connected those three facts.

  Provisioning now reports itself:

  - **Wholesale skip is a `warn`, naming the consequence** — the tables stay
    lazy-created on first WRITE, so an env that READS one first (the home page
    activity feed queries `sys_activity` before any mutation) logs "no such
    table" until something writes.
  - **One `info` line per boot listing where each table landed** —
    `sys_audit_log→telemetry, sys_activity→telemetry, sys_comment→sqlite`,
    resolved through the engine's own `getDriverForObject`, so the log states the
    routing rather than leaving it to be inferred.
  - **A second `info` line when the ADR-0057 split is in effect**, saying
    explicitly that those tables live in a different store — on SQLite, a
    different _file_ — and that anything reading them without naming the object
    (raw SQL against the default datasource) will report "no such table" even
    though provisioning succeeded.
  - **An object that resolves to no driver is a `warn`** — `syncObjectSchema()`
    returns without issuing any DDL in that case and throws nothing, so the
    per-object `catch` never fires; from outside the engine this is the only place
    it can be observed.

  Behaviour is otherwise unchanged: the same three objects are synced, per-object
  failures stay isolated, and an engine without on-demand DDL still degrades
  instead of failing `start()`.

- 0162c81: fix(plugin-audit): stop mirroring `sys_job_queue` traffic into the audit ledger (#5193)

  `SKIP_OBJECTS` in `audit-writers.ts` excludes operational telemetry / plumbing
  from `sys_audit_log` and `sys_activity` — ADR-0057 decision 5, _"stop the
  amplifier"_. Its group (2) already listed `sys_job`, `sys_job_run` and
  `sys_automation_run`; `sys_job_queue` — the highest-volume table of that same
  family — was the one sibling missing, so every durable queue message was
  mirrored into both sinks.

  The audit hooks register for **all** objects (`afterInsert` / `afterUpdate` /
  `afterDelete`) and there is no "writes made under a system context are not
  audited" exemption, so `DbQueueAdapter`'s own writes were recorded like user
  edits. One message costs at least three of them — the publish insert, the lease
  `pending → running` update and the terminal `→ completed` update, plus one retry
  update per failure and the reaper's periodic DELETE of completed rows — each
  producing an `sys_audit_log` **and** an `sys_activity` row. Since queue-backed
  email delivery landed, that ran on every single mail. Each `beforeUpdate` also
  paid an extra `findOne` snapshot of the row it was about to change.

  `sys_job_queue` is engine-owned plumbing (`managedBy: 'engine-owned'`,
  `enable.apiMethods: ['get', 'list']`, `lifecycle.class: 'transient'`) that no
  user can write, so those rows carried no compliance value — only noise and write
  amplification. Nothing else changes: the exemption is one name in one list, and
  ordinary business objects are audited exactly as before.

  Operators who charted queue throughput off `sys_activity` should read
  `sys_job_queue` directly instead — it is the system of record for queue state,
  and unlike the audit sinks it is exposed for reading (`get` / `list`).

- 055f0c9: fix(plugin-audit): stop mirroring chunked-upload progress into the audit ledger (#5202)

  `SKIP_OBJECTS` in `audit-writers.ts` excludes operational telemetry / plumbing
  from `sys_audit_log` and `sys_activity` — ADR-0057 decision 5, _"stop the
  amplifier"_. `sys_upload_session` was the second table missing from group (2)
  for the same reason `sys_job_queue` was (#5193): it declares
  `lifecycle.class: 'transient'` and its own object comment says what the rows are
  worth — _"an upload session is ephemeral state, never business truth"_
  (ADR-0057 / #2970 item 4) — but nothing connected that declaration to the
  exemption list, which is hand-written.

  The audit hooks register for **all** objects and there is no "writes made under
  a system context are not audited" exemption, so `StorageMetadataStore`'s own
  writes were recorded like user edits. A chunked upload of N parts costs 1 + N
  writes — the `createSession()` insert plus one `updateSession()` per chunk — and
  then a terminal status update and the row's removal, each producing an
  `sys_audit_log` **and** an `sys_activity` row: 2 × (1 + N) rows for one file,
  with a `beforeUpdate` snapshot read apiece. Each of those rows was also unusually
  fat, because `updateSession()` writes the merged **full** record, so the `parts`
  JSON blob that grows with every chunk rode along in each diff's `old_value` /
  `new_value`.

  Nothing else changes: the exemption is one name in one list, and ordinary
  business objects are audited exactly as before. In particular `sys_file` stays
  audited — it declares `transient` too, but only to reap tombstones and
  unfinished uploads; its rows are mostly permanent business truth and keep their
  compliance value.

  Operators who tracked upload activity through `sys_activity` should read
  `sys_upload_session` (in-progress state) and `sys_file` (the durable record of
  what was actually stored) instead.

- e18e3da: 审计行写失败改为 `error` 级,并只报一次

  按 AGENTS.md「Degradation log levels」的判据,审计写失败属 **durability / data-consistency** 类而非 functional 类:被审计的那次写入本身成功、数据已落库、接口返回 200,从外面看一切正常,只有记录「谁做的」的 `sys_audit_log` 行没有落地,而且没有任何重试。这正是 #4420 在合规账本上的同一形状,因此原先的 `WARN Audit write failed` 升级为 `error`。

  这条 `error` 同时给出**后果**与**修复方向**:审计轨迹已不完整;`sys_audit_log` 受 ADR-0057 §3.6 生命周期分流,注册了 `telemetry` 数据源时会被路由过去(`os dev` 默认以兄弟 SQLite 文件形式提供一个),所以出现 "no such table" 通常意味着该次写入执行在了与建表处**不同**的数据源连接上;`OS_TELEMETRY_DB=0` 可让所有 lifecycle-classed 对象留在主数据源。

  审计写发生在**每一次**数据变更上,因此该 `error` 全进程**只报一次**(后续失败降为 `debug`,细节仍可通过提高日志级别取回)—— 每次失败都报一遍会训练所有人略过 `error`,而这正是当初让 #4420 的 `warn` 无人阅读的反射。

  写入点提取为具名的 `persistAuditTrailRow`,并登记进 `scripts/check-durability-degradation-log-level.mjs` 的 `DURABILITY_CRITICAL_CALLEES`,由 `pnpm check:durability-log-level` 守住该级别,防止日后被悄悄改回 `warn`。

### Major Changes

- be90dea: fix(plugin-audit,rest)!: `sys_comment` derives its access from the record its thread names (#4630)

  Attachments derive their visibility from the parent record; comments derived
  nothing. On the _same_ record, with the _same_ user, the two answered
  differently:

  ```
  user: rep2 (does NOT own and cannot read the opportunity)
  GET  /api/v1/data/crm_opportunity?$filter=["id","=","1A7n…"]      → 200, 0 rows
  GET  /api/v1/data/sys_attachment?$filter=["parent_id","=","1A7n…"] → 200, 0 rows
  GET  /api/v1/data/sys_comment?$filter=["thread_id","=","crm_opportunity:1A7n…"]
                                                                     → 200, 1 row
  POST /api/v1/data/sys_comment {"thread_id":"crm_opportunity:", …}  → 201 Created
  ```

  `sys_comment` is public, has no owner column, and hides its parent inside a
  string (`thread_id` = `{object_name}:{record_id}`), so neither OWD/sharing nor
  RLS ever narrowed it. Because `enable.feeds` is opt-OUT (spec default `true`),
  every object in every app carried that org-wide readable, org-wide writable
  side-channel — a deployment that carefully authored OWD, sharing rules and RLS
  on its records still leaked their discussion.

  `AuditPlugin` now installs the same two-part kit `service-storage` installs for
  `sys_attachment`, keyed off `thread_id`'s parent:

  - **read** — a `find`/`findOne`/`count`/`aggregate` middleware intersects every
    query with the threads whose record the caller can actually read (resolved
    through the caller-scoped engine, so the parent's own OWD/sharing/RLS/CRUD
    decide). `count()` is filtered identically to `find()`, so a list `total`
    cannot leak the hidden rows' existence either.
  - **write** — `beforeInsert` requires READ on the record the thread names;
    `beforeUpdate` / `beforeDelete` require the caller to be the comment's AUTHOR
    or to hold EDIT on that record. `author_id` is server-stamped from the
    session, so a client-supplied value never wins.

  Everything fails CLOSED: a `thread_id` that names no record — the dangling
  `"crm_opportunity:"` above, a free-form thread, a thread on `sys_comment`
  itself — is refused on write and excluded on read, and a filter that cannot be
  computed denies all rather than falling open. Refusals answer **403
  `RECORD_NOT_ACCESSIBLE`** (the standard error catalog, per ADR-0112 — a generic
  permission condition takes a catalogued code rather than a new synonym), with
  `error.object` naming the record's object.

  **Breaking for deployments that depended on the gap.** Reads that used to
  return other people's comments now return fewer rows (or none), and writes that
  used to 201 now 403. Specifically:

  - Listing `sys_comment` without being able to read the parent record → the row
    is gone, not merely unlabelled. Panels that render a thread must be reached by
    a principal who can read the record.
  - Threads whose `thread_id` is not `{object_name}:{record_id}` are no longer
    usable at all: creating one is refused, and existing rows become invisible to
    everyone but system context. Migrate free-form threads to a real record
    reference (or keep them under a system-context surface).
  - Deleting or editing another user's comment now requires EDIT on the record.
    Note also that `sys_comment` delete already needed a permission set carrying
    `allowDelete` — the `member_default` baseline has none (ADR-0090 D5).
  - Posting a comment no longer requires the client to send `author_id` (it is
    stamped); a client that sends someone else's is silently corrected rather than
    believed.

  Orthogonal and unchanged: `enable.feeds` (`FEEDS_DISABLED`) still gates whether
  an object has comments at all, and anonymous callers are still refused with 401
  before any of this runs.

### Minor Changes

- ce5242c: feat(auth,objectql,audit,security,spec): identity-table writes carry the real actor, so `sys_member` history stops saying "system" (#4586)

  better-auth owns every write to the identity tables (`sys_member`, `sys_user`,
  `sys_invitation`, …) and its ObjectQL adapter runs them `isSystem: true` **on
  purpose** — the route already authorized the action under better-auth's own ACL,
  and ADR-0092 D2 refuses user-context writes to those tables outright. The
  consequence was that the human who clicked _make admin_ was known exactly once,
  in the hook layer where the session exists, and then discarded: every
  `trackHistory` transition on `sys_member` recorded `user_id: null` / "system",
  and `sys_user_permission_set.granted_by` was written null by the auto-grant.
  "Who made this person an org admin?" had no answer in the platform's own audit
  log.

  **What changed**

  A request-scoped attribution seam, general rather than a `sys_member` special
  case:

  | Layer                        | Before                             | After                                                                                                                          |
  | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ExecutionContext`           | `userId` / `actor` only            | new optional `attributedUserId` — the human CREDITED for a write the system AUTHORIZED                                         |
  | `HookContext`                | `session`, `user`                  | new `provenance.attributedUserId`, split off the context beside `session`                                                      |
  | better-auth ObjectQL adapter | `{ isSystem: true }`               | `{ isSystem: true, attributedUserId }` when a request scope is open                                                            |
  | audit writer                 | `user_id = session.userId ?? null` | falls back to `provenance.attributedUserId` when the session names nobody                                                      |
  | `auto-org-admin-grant`       | `granted_by: null`, no `reason`    | the attributed human in `granted_by`, plus a machine-provenance `reason` naming the writer and the triggering `sys_member` row |

  Outside a request scope nothing changes: writes stay bare `{ isSystem: true }`
  and audit rows keep recording `null`. Absence is still never upgraded into a
  caller, and never written as a sentinel string (ADR-0118 D1/D2).

  **Hard constraint — attribution is not authority**

  `attributedUserId` is read by exactly one consumer, the audit writer, and by no
  security middleware. It never becomes `ExecutionContext.userId`, so it is never
  the subject the engine authorizes as: not RLS `current_user`, not the ownership
  stamp, not permission resolution. A context carrying only `attributedUserId`
  authorizes exactly like an empty context (ANONYMOUS), and a context carrying it
  beside `isSystem: true` authorizes exactly like `isSystem` alone. Re-authorizing
  identity writes as the human would re-adjudicate a decision better-auth already
  made — the second adjudication track ADR-0095 D3 closed. The constraint is
  pinned by tests at three layers: the engine seam
  (`packages/objectql/src/engine.test.ts`), the better-auth adapter
  (`packages/plugins/plugin-auth/src/auth-actor-attribution.test.ts`), and the
  live HTTP route (a plain member still cannot promote themselves).

  **For authors and plugin developers**

  `attributedUserId` is authorable on `ExecutionContext` and readable as
  `ctx.provenance?.attributedUserId` in hooks. Use it to answer _who is
  responsible_; keep using `ctx.session` / `ctx.user` to decide _what is
  permitted_. The two are separate fields precisely so the distinction cannot be
  blurred by accident.

- 04b9776: feat(plugin-audit)!: retire `sys_comment.visibility` and `sys_comment.reply_count` (#4756, ADR-0049)

  Both fields were modelled with **zero** runtime consumers — nothing in this repo,
  in `objectui`, or in `cloud` ever read or maintained either one. ADR-0049
  enforce-or-remove; maintainer decision: remove both. Same disposition, and for
  the same stated reason, as `sys_attachment.share_type` / `sys_attachment.visibility`
  in #2755 ("attachment access is derived from the parent record").

  **REMOVED — `sys_comment.visibility`** (`'public' | 'internal' | 'private'`,
  defaulted `'public'`).

  This one is a **security-looking key with no gate behind it**, which is the
  primary reason it goes rather than stays. No code path consulted it: not
  `enforceFeedsCapability`, not the record-level gates added in #4630, not the
  REST layer, not objectui's discussion panel. A comment an author marked
  `private` was visible to exactly the same people as a `public` one — an app
  author (or an AI authoring metadata) reading the field list would reasonably
  believe otherwise, and get a silent security failure instead of an error. That
  is the Prime Directive #10 trap in its textbook shape.

  There is **no replacement key**: after #4630, who can see a comment is decided
  by the record-level permissions of the record its `thread_id` names — one
  coherent rule. A per-row enum layered on top would be a second source of truth
  for the same question. The enum's only genuinely missing meaning ("hidden from
  external/portal principals") depends on external principals existing at all,
  which waits on ADR-0090 D11's `externalSharingModel`; today there is nobody to
  hide a comment from. This does not foreclose that design — when portals land,
  a visibility key can return **enforce-first**, with a real gate and tests.

  **FROM → TO:** stop sending `visibility` on `sys_comment` writes; to restrict
  who sees a discussion, restrict who can read the record `thread_id` points at.

  **REMOVED — `sys_comment.reply_count`** (`number`, `defaultValue: 0`,
  `readonly: true`).

  Never incremented anywhere, and `readonly` meant an author could not set it by
  hand either, so every row read `0` forever — a UI binding an "N replies" badge
  to it rendered `0` for every thread. Deliberately **not** replaced by an
  `afterInsert`/`afterDelete` roll-up: the predicate/bulk write-hook gaps tracked
  by #4770 / #4778 / #4779 (a hook that returns early without a single-record id
  lets the whole bulk operation through) are exactly where a hook-maintained
  counter drifts — a bulk delete of replies would never decrement it. A counter
  that drifts is worse than no counter, because both the UI and an AI reading the
  record trust it. If a badge needs the number, aggregate `parent_id` children at
  read time; a designed roll-up can be revisited once #4775's family has settled
  bulk-hook semantics.

  **FROM → TO:** replace reads of `reply_count` with a count of `sys_comment` rows
  whose `parent_id` is the comment's id.

  **Stored data.** Existing databases keep both columns as **unmanaged leftovers**
  — no migration, matching #2755. What changes where:

  - **Reads are loud everywhere.** The read-axis gates (#4134 / #4226) resolve
    field names from the object schema, not from the table, so a filter, sort,
    `select` or `expand` naming `visibility` / `reply_count` now answers
    `400 INVALID_FIELD` on every deployment, leftover column or not. A "0 replies"
    badge that silently lied becomes an error that names itself.
  - **Writes are loud on new databases only.** A database provisioned after this
    change has no such column, so the write fails at the driver and is mapped to
    the same `400 INVALID_FIELD` envelope. On a pre-existing database the leftover
    column still accepts a value nothing will ever read — record validation does
    not reject undeclared keys. Dropping the two columns is an optional manual
    cleanup, not a requirement.

### Patch Changes

- a946efd: fix(plugin-audit): the localized-summary tests stop charging a cold module load to one test's timeout (#4186)

  `audit-writers.test.ts` resolved `@objectstack/core` and its translation
  bundle with `await import(...)` inside the first localized test's helper, so
  that single test paid the whole cold-start cost — resolution plus vite
  transform of a large barrel — while every later case ran warmed in ~1ms.

  That cost is real work being billed to a per-test timeout budget. The file
  already carried a `{ timeout: 20_000 }` override for exactly this reason (its
  comment measured the cold start at ~5s on a 4-vCPU runner). Under a full-repo
  `pnpm test`, where a dozen packages' vitest workers compete, the cold start
  grew past that bound too and the case failed at 20s — reproducibly in CI-like
  load, never in isolation, which is the worst shape a red test can have: it
  tracks machine load rather than code.

  Both imports are now static. The same work happens during collection, which no
  single test's timeout is charged for, so the previously failing case runs in
  1ms and the timeout override is gone — the default timeout is now an honest
  bound, and a case that exceeds it is a real hang rather than a slow import.

- 2e836de: chore(packaging): CHANGELOG.md ships in every npm tarball (#4261)

  The AGENTS.md post-task checklist requires breaking changesets to carry their
  FROM → TO migration because "this text ships to consumers as `CHANGELOG.md`
  inside the npm package and is what an upgrading agent greps after the tombstone
  error." That delivery path was severed for 68 of the 69 publishable packages:
  npm packs `package.json` / `README*` / `LICENSE*` unconditionally but — unlike
  older npm versions — not `CHANGELOG.md`, and the canonical
  `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]` whitelist never named it. Measured on npm
  10.9.7: `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/types` shipped 3 files while its
  70KB `CHANGELOG.md` stayed behind. Only `@objectstack/spec` listed it
  explicitly.

  The tombstone-error scenario is precisely the one where the repo is out of
  reach — the upgrading agent has `node_modules` and nothing else — so the
  migration text has to ride in the tarball. Every publishable package now
  declares `CHANGELOG.md` in `files`, and the canonical whitelist is
  `["dist", "README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]`.

  The other half is the gate: `check:published-files` gains a fifth invariant,
  COMPLETE — a whitelist that fails to cover `CHANGELOG.md` fails the
  always-required lint job, so the next package cannot silently sever the path
  again. `@objectstack/spec`'s per-package EXTRA_ENTRIES exemption dissolves
  into the canonical set.

  Consumer-visible change: one more file per install (the package's changelog,
  e.g. 70.8KB for `@objectstack/types`), and `grep -r "removed key"
node_modules/@objectstack/*/CHANGELOG.md` now finds the migration it was
  promised.

- a8dcc37: fix(service-messaging,plugin-audit): the service that writes `sys_notification` is the one that declares it (#4154)

  `MessagingService.emit()` writes `sys_notification` on every call — it is the
  pipeline's single ingress (ADR-0030 L2). But the object was contributed to the
  manifest by **`AuditPlugin`**, parked there with a comment saying it would stay
  "until that [ADR-0030] migration lands". The migration landed; the parking did
  not move.

  That left a real deployment hole, because `AuditPlugin` is an **optional** pair
  in the CLI's plugin table. Install messaging without audit and nothing registers
  the object, so the engine has no schema to issue DDL from and every `notify()`
  fails with `no such table: sys_notification`. AuditPlugin never wrote the row
  itself — it deliberately routes through this service's `emit()` ingress
  (`getMessaging()` in `audit-writers.ts`), and its own exclusion list already
  annotates the object as "messaging-owned (ADR-0030)".

  The contribution now lives with the writer, matching how every other
  service-owned platform object is handled in this repo — `service-job` imports
  `SysJob`/`SysJobRun`, `service-queue` imports `SysJobQueue`, `rest` imports
  `SysImportJob`. Ownership of the _definition_ is unchanged: the object stays in
  `@objectstack/platform-objects` and in `PLATFORM_OBJECTS_BY_PACKAGE`, because
  owning a definition and contributing it to a running kernel are different
  things. It is also added to the service's `provisionSystemTables`, so the table
  is created with the rest of the pipeline it heads rather than lazily on the
  first write.

  Found while migrating `notifications.hono.integration.test.ts` to in-memory
  SQLite in #4065: that suite had to register the object itself to boot, which was
  the deployment bug in miniature. The workaround is deleted in this change — the
  suite now boots messaging alone and passes, which is the proof the product
  declares what it writes.

### Minor Changes

- f243727: remove(plugin-audit): drop the kernel's built-in assignment notifications; move the policy to user-space automation (#3403)

  **Breaking (behavioral).** `plugin-audit` no longer emits a `collab.assignment`
  notification when an owner/assignee field changes on a record. Deciding that an
  assignment warrants a bell is a business policy, not a platform default — the
  kernel version guessed "who is the assignee" from field names (`owner_id`,
  `assigned_to`, `assignee_id`, `owner`, `assignee`), which misfired on system
  records like `sys_file` and spammed users with "…assigned to you" noise on file
  uploads (#3402).

  **What was removed:** the `writeAssignmentNotifications` writer, the `OWNER_FIELDS`
  heuristic, and the `messages.assignedToYou` translation key (en / zh-CN / ja-JP /
  es-ES). **Unaffected:** `sys_audit_log` / `sys_activity` capture, and `@mention`
  notifications (`collab.mention`) — those remain platform behavior. The
  `owner_of:` messaging audience and `service-messaging`'s `DEFAULT_OWNER_FIELDS`
  are a separate, caller-requested mechanism and are unchanged.

  **FROM → TO migration.** If you relied on the automatic bell, configure an
  automation flow on the target object (`record-after-update` / `record-after-create`
  trigger + a `notify` node). The `condition` can read the pre-update row via
  `previous`, and `notify`'s `recipients` / `title` / `actionUrl` all interpolate
  record fields. Ready-made example: `showcase_task_assigned_notify` in
  `examples/app-showcase/src/automation/flows/index.ts`:

  ```ts
  { id: 'start', type: 'start', config: {
      objectName: 'your_object',
      triggerType: 'record-after-update',
      condition: 'assignee != previous.assignee',
  } },
  { id: 'notify_assignee', type: 'notify', config: {
      topic: 'task.assigned',
      recipients: ['{record.assignee}'],
      channels: ['inbox'],
      title: 'New assignment: {record.title}',
      actionUrl: '/your_object/{record.id}',
  } },
  ```

  Notes on parity: the flow template renders a single language (the kernel version
  localized the title to the recipient's locale); a flow fires on every real change
  (the `previous` condition already gates that) and, unless you add an actor guard,
  also notifies self-assignments — the kernel version suppressed those.

### Patch Changes

- aff9e56: fix(i18n): translate the platform packages' declared surface, and gate all nine bundles instead of one (#3762)

  Only `platform-objects` was wired into a translation-drift check. The other
  **eight** packages shipped a `scripts/i18n-extract.config.ts` that nothing ever
  ran — and four of them had already drifted out of sync with the schema, exactly
  the rot `pnpm check:i18n` exists to catch, one directory over.

  **Translated.** `plugin-security` (45 strings per locale), `plugin-webhooks`
  (15), `plugin-audit` (8), `plugin-sharing` (7) and `service-storage` (7) are now
  at **zero** untranslated declared strings in zh-CN / ja-JP / es-ES — 246
  translations. Most were newly _visible_ rather than newly missing: #3753 taught
  the coverage detector to walk action `params`, `resultDialog`, `listViews` and
  the rest of the declared surface, and these are what it found.

  Wording was harvested from the repo's own bundles wherever a string was already
  translated somewhere (1382 unambiguous source strings), so `Created At` reads
  `创建时间` here because that is what it reads everywhere else, rather than a
  fresh invention. Protocol tokens are deliberately left identical across locales:
  `GET` / `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` / `DELETE`, `ETag`, `ACL`, `URL`.

  **Gated.** `scripts/check-i18n-bundles.mjs` replaces the single-package
  `pnpm check:i18n` and checks all nine. It does not restate each package's
  command — it parses the one already documented in that config's own docstring
  and runs it, so the documented regenerate command and the gate cannot diverge.
  The coverage ratchet grows the same way, from `examples/*` to twelve configs;
  eight of them sit at zero, which makes it the strict gate there.

  **Fixed a real truncation bug it exposed.** `os lint --json` on a large config
  came out of a pipe cut off at exactly 65536 bytes — `console.log(big)` followed
  by `process.exit(1)` tears the process down before an async pipe write drains,
  while an interactive run (stdout is a TTY, written synchronously) looks perfect.
  Every scripted consumer silently got invalid JSON. `emitJson` in
  `packages/cli/src/utils/format.ts` waits for the write to drain and sets
  `process.exitCode` instead; `lint`, `i18n check` and `i18n extract` use it.
  Roughly 30 other CLI commands share the pattern and are not touched here.

  The nine documented regenerate commands also gain `--no-metadata-forms` (added
  in #3768), since the Studio metadata-form baseline belongs to `platform-objects`
  alone, not to a copy in every plugin.

  Not fixed here: `platform-objects`' own 77-per-locale gap is `apps.*` /
  `dashboards.*` navigation and widget labels, which live outside the `objects`
  subtree and cannot be scaffolded while the package extracts with
  `--objects-only`. That needs an emit decision first — tracked in #3762.

### Patch Changes

- 2ea08ee: Flow trigger observability — kill the four-layer silence around record-change flows that never fire (2026-07-17 third-party eval).

  A misauthored auto-launched flow (wrong `objectName`, missing `requires: ['automation','triggers']`, failing start condition) produced ZERO output at every layer: the engine's own registration/binding logs land inside the CLI's boot-quiet stdout window (which swallows debug/info/warn — only error/fatal reach stderr), and each "didn't happen" path was itself silent. Fixes:

- ee0a499: feat(i18n): localize collaboration notification titles and the storage objects; wire the notifications REST routes

  Three gaps behind one report (a `sys_file "repro.png" assigned to you`
  notification that was English on an all-Chinese workspace, opened an English
  detail page, and never cleared its unread state):

  - **plugin-audit** — the assignment (`collab.assignment`) and @mention
    (`collab.mention`) bell titles were hardcoded English literals built from the
    raw object API name. They now resolve through the i18n service with the same
    key shapes as the activity summaries (framework#3039): new
    `messages.assignedToYou` / `messages.mentionedYou` /
    `messages.mentionedYouAnonymous` templates (en / zh-CN / ja-JP / es-ES), the
    object named by its translated label (`objects.{name}.label` → authored def
    label → API name), and the locale resolved for the **recipient** (they read
    the bell), not the acting user. Every step stays best-effort: no locale / no
    i18n / key miss degrades to the English literal — which now also prefers the
    authored object label over the API name.

  - **service-storage** — `sys_file` / `sys_upload_session` had no translation
    bundle at all, so the file detail page (labels, and the Pending Upload /
    Committed / Deleted status pipeline) rendered English on every locale. The
    service now ships its own ADR-0029 D8 bundle (en / zh-CN / ja-JP / es-ES,
    `src/translations` + `scripts/i18n-extract.config.ts`) and contributes it via
    `i18n.loadTranslations` on `kernel:ready`, matching service-messaging.
    (`sys_attachment` stays in platform-objects' bundles pending the
    storage-domain decomposition.)

  - **runtime** — the in-app notifications REST surface (`GET
/api/v1/notifications`, `POST /api/v1/notifications/read`, `POST
/api/v1/notifications/read/all`; ADR-0030) had its `handleNotification`
    dispatch branch and discovery entry, but no `server.<verb>()` mount in
    `dispatcher-plugin`, so only the cloud hosts' hono catch-all reached it — the
    standalone / `os dev` server 404'd every request. That left mark-read with no
    working endpoint (the console's direct `sys_notification_receipt` write is
    rejected by ADR-0103's engine-owned gate), so unread notifications could never
    clear. The three routes are now mounted explicitly, guarded by the
    route-registration regression test.

### Patch Changes

- 2ea08ee: Flow trigger observability — kill the four-layer silence around record-change flows that never fire (2026-07-17 third-party eval).

  A misauthored auto-launched flow (wrong `objectName`, missing `requires: ['automation','triggers']`, failing start condition) produced ZERO output at every layer: the engine's own registration/binding logs land inside the CLI's boot-quiet stdout window (which swallows debug/info/warn — only error/fatal reach stderr), and each "didn't happen" path was itself silent. Fixes:

  - **Startup banner `Flows:` section** (`os serve`/`os dev`/`os start`): flow count, bound-to-trigger count, registered trigger types, draft count — plus loud `⚠` lines for flows declared with no automation engine enabled (`requires` missing), flows whose trigger type has no registered trigger, and bound record-change flows targeting an unknown object (dead binding). Printed after stdout is restored, so it is immune to the boot-quiet window.
  - **Trigger-fired run failures now log at ERROR** (stderr — always visible): the automation engine no longer drops the AutomationResult of a trigger-fired execution; condition-evaluation faults and node failures surface with the flow name. Condition-not-met skips stay at debug (high-frequency, intentional).
  - **`RecordChangeTrigger` probes object existence at bind time** and warns when a flow's `objectName` matches no registered object (exact-name matching), instead of silently arming a hook that can never fire.

## 15.1.0

### Patch Changes

- f531a26: ADR-0085 #2548 follow-ups surfaced by the real-backend browser pass:

  - **lint**: new `field-group-shadowed` warning in `validate-semantic-roles` — a
    declared fieldGroup whose every visible member is hoisted into the detail
    highlight strip (or is the record title) renders on forms but silently never
    on detail pages (detail bodies hide the first 4 highlightFields). Warning
    tier, same as the other semantic-role rules.
  - **plugin-audit**: feed/audit summaries ("Created … / Deleted … / Updated …")
    now name the object by its display label ("Semantic Zoo") instead of its API
    name ("showcase_semantic_zoo") — these strings render verbatim in the record
    Discussion feed and Setup dashboards. Falls back to the API name when the
    object definition isn't resolvable. Existing stored rows are unchanged.

- f531a26: Localize activity summaries to the workspace default locale (#3039). Activity
  writers previously hardcoded English verbs and the object API name
  (`Created person_qualification "OC-00001"`). The writer now resolves the
  ADR-0053 `localization.locale` setting per write (memoized per tenant/user
  scope), renders the verb through new `messages.activityCreated/Updated/Deleted`
  i18n templates (en, zh-CN, ja-JP, es-ES shipped), and names the object by its
  localized label (`objects.{name}.label`) with fallback to the authored def
  label, then the API name. Missing i18n/settings services or bundle keys
  degrade to the previous English summaries.

### Minor Changes

- 7953832: ADR-0057 data lifecycle P1–P4 (#2786): platform-generated data is now bounded by construction.

  - **P1 — contract**: new `lifecycle` object property (`class: record | audit | telemetry | transient | event` + `retention` / `ttl` / `storage(rotation)` / `archive` / `reclaim`), enforced by the platform-owned **LifecycleService** registered by `ObjectQLPlugin` (default-on; disable via `OS_LIFECYCLE_DISABLED=1` or plugin `lifecycle.enabled=false`). The Reaper batch-deletes rows past `retention.maxAge` / `ttl` under a system context and reclaims space (`SqlDriver.reclaimSpace()` → SQLite `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum`). Non-`record` classes must declare a bounding policy (parse-time invariant + spec-liveness gate + dogfood storage-growth gate).
  - **P2 — rotation**: `storage: { strategy: 'rotation', shards, unit }` physically time-shards the table on SQLite — writes land in the current shard, reads go through a UNION-ALL view under the base name, expiry is an O(1) `DROP` of shards past the window. A legacy table is adopted as the first shard on upgrade. Other dialects fall back to an equivalent age-based reap.
  - **P3 — separation + Archiver**: registering a datasource named `telemetry` routes telemetry/event/audit objects to it (opt-in by existence; `transient` deliberately stays on the primary). Audit objects with `archive` declared get retain → archive → delete once the archive datasource exists; without it rows are retained, never dropped unarchived.
  - **P4 — governance**: new `lifecycle` settings namespace — runtime enable switch, per-object retention overrides (tenant-scoped: regulated tenants set years, dev sets days), per-object/per-class row quotas and growth alerts (observe-and-alert only).

  **Behavior change**: 11 platform objects now carry lifecycle declarations and their telemetry is bounded by default — `sys_activity` 14d (rotated), `sys_audit_log` 90d hot → archive (retained forever until an `archive` datasource is registered), `sys_metadata_audit` 365d → archive, `sys_job_run` / `sys_automation_run` / `sys_http_delivery` 30d, notification pipeline (`sys_notification`, delivery, receipt, inbox) 90d, `sys_device_code` expires_at + 1d. Extend windows per environment/tenant via the `lifecycle.retention_overrides` setting.

### Minor Changes

- e2fa074: feat(data): make object `enable.feeds`/`enable.activities` real opt-out gates; define the `enable.trackHistory` contract (#2707)

  `ObjectSchema.enable.{files,trackHistory,activities,feeds}` were parsed but
  (mostly) unconsumed — an author setting them got nothing, silently. Per the
  enforce-or-remove doctrine, each flag now has a defined enforcement contract:

  - `enable.activities` — opt-OUT writer gate. Spec default flips
    `false → true`; plugin-audit keeps mirroring CRUD into the `sys_activity`
    timeline unless the object declares an explicit `activities: false`
    (behavior-preserving for every existing stack; the off-switch is the
    per-object lever for activity-row growth, ADR-0057). The compliance
    `sys_audit_log` row is NOT gated.
  - `enable.feeds` — opt-OUT with server-side enforcement. Spec default flips
    `false → true`; an explicit `feeds: false` now rejects `sys_comment`
    creation targeting that object at the engine hook seam
    (403 `FEEDS_DISABLED`, fail-closed like `CLONE_DISABLED`).
  - `enable.trackHistory` — was misclassified `dead` in the liveness ledger:
    the console has gated the record History tab on it since 2026-05.
    Reclassified live with the two-grain contract documented (object flag =
    History-tab master switch; per-field `trackHistory` = diff selector; audit
    _capture_ stays unconditional as a compliance ledger).
  - `enable.files` — stays dead + authorWarn (reserved for the future generic
    Attachments panel; use `Field.file`/`Field.image` meanwhile). Its
    `describe()` now says so instead of advertising a capability that
    doesn't exist.

  The default flips can't be avoided: with `default(false)`, compiled output
  materializes `false` for every object with an `enable` block, making
  "author explicitly opted out" indistinguishable from "schema default" — so
  opt-out semantics require the default to be `true` (same posture as
  `trash`/`mru`/`clone`). Liveness ledger + reference docs regenerated;
  compile-time authorWarn now fires only for `enable.files`.

- 23c8668: feat(data): `enable.files` goes live — opt-in gate for the generic Attachments surface (#2727)

  The last dead ObjectCapabilities flag gets its enforcement contract.
  `enable.files` is opt-IN (spec default stays `false`): the generic record
  Attachments panel is a new surface, not an existing behavior.

  - plugin-audit registers a `sys_attachment` beforeInsert hook: attachment
    join rows may only target objects that explicitly declare
    `enable: { files: true }` — anything else (absent block, absent flag,
    explicit false, unknown object) rejects fail-closed with
    403 `FILES_DISABLED` (CLONE_DISABLED / FEEDS_DISABLED pattern).
  - `mapDataError` maps `FILES_DISABLED` → 403 with the gated target object
    (generic data routes bypass `sendError`'s `.status` passthrough — the
    #2707 lesson, applied at introduction time).
  - `Field.file` / `Field.image` are deliberately independent: they store
    the file URL in the record's own column and never create
    `sys_attachment` rows, so field-level attachments work regardless of
    this flag.
  - Liveness ledger: `enable.files` dead→live, authorWarn dropped —
    ObjectCapabilities is now 100% live. The compile-time
    liveness-dead-property warning no longer fires for it; `describe()` and
    the reference docs state the real contract.

  Companion objectui PR ships `RecordAttachmentsPanel` (upload/list/
  download/delete over the presigned three-step storage flow), rendered on
  record pages when the flag is true.

## 11.10.0

### Patch Changes

- 6a9397e: Retire the deprecated `compactLayout` alias for `highlightFields` (framework#2536, closes the ADR-0085 deprecation window).

  - `ObjectSchema` no longer declares `compactLayout`: `create()` rejects it like any unknown key; lenient `parse()` strips it (no silent aliasing).
  - The parse-time alias AND the `highlightFields → compactLayout` back-fill transition mirror are removed from `normalizeSemanticRoleAliases`. Served metadata now carries the canonical key only.
  - All remaining first-party authors (27 system objects across plugin-audit / approvals / security / sharing / webhooks / service-storage / automation / messaging / realtime — missed by the #2521 sweep, caught by the type gate) renamed to `highlightFields`.
  - The downstream smoke pin moves to hotcrm v1.2.2 (hotcrm#424: same rename + deps ^11.7.0).
  - Consumers were switched in objectui#2168 and shipped via the console pin bump (#2526); this closes the window scheduled there. The dogfood mirror assertion (#2528) flips to `compactLayout: undefined` in this same change, per the plan it carried.

  Version note: minor, not major — the key was deprecated-with-alias for a full release window, all first-party consumers/authors are migrated, and the spec api-surface gate reports no export changes (same documented-exception path as the ADR-0085 removals in 11.7.0). External metadata still authoring `compactLayout` will now fail `create()` loudly with the standard unknown-key error naming the key.

### Minor Changes

- 13632b1: ADR-0030 P0 (framework) — converge notifications onto a single ingress and the
  layered model. Every producer now publishes through
  `NotificationService.emit(EmitInput)`; the in-app inbox is a materialization of
  delivery, not a row producers write.

  **Single ingress (`@objectstack/service-messaging`) — breaking**

  - `MessagingService.emit` takes the new `EmitInput` contract (`topic` /
    `audience` / `payload` / `severity` / `dedupKey` / `source` / `actorId` /
    `organizationId` / `channels`) instead of the flat `Notification` shape. It
    writes the L2 `sys_notification` event (idempotent on `dedupKey`), resolves the
    audience, then fans out; it returns `{ notificationId, deduped, deliveries,
delivered, failed }`.
  - New `sys_notification_receipt` object — the read-state spine
    (`delivered|read|clicked|dismissed`), keyed `(notification_id, user_id,
channel)`. The inbox channel writes a `delivered` receipt on materialization.
  - `sys_inbox_message`: adds `notification_id` / `delivery_id`, **drops `read`**
    (read-state moved to the receipt), adds the user `mine` list view.

  **Event re-model (`@objectstack/platform-objects`) — breaking**

  - `sys_notification` is re-modeled from a per-user inbox into the L2 **event**
    (`topic`, `payload`, `severity`, `dedup_key`, `source_*`, `actor_id`). Removes
    `recipient_id` / `is_read` / `read_at` / `type` / `title` / `body` / `url` /
    `actor_name` and the inbox actions/views. App-nav: the account inbox points at
    `sys_inbox_message`; Setup shows the notification event log.

  **Producers routed through `emit()`**

  - `@objectstack/service-automation`: the `notify` node maps its config to
    `EmitInput`.
  - `@objectstack/plugin-audit`: collaboration `@mention` → `collab.mention` and
    assignment → `collab.assignment` (both with a `dedupKey`); no more direct
    `sys_notification` writes. Collaboration notifications now require
    `MessagingServicePlugin` (they degrade to a warn otherwise).

  **Migration (`@objectstack/metadata`)**

  - Idempotent `migrateSysNotificationToEvent` splits legacy `sys_notification`
    inbox rows into `sys_inbox_message` + receipts and rewrites the event row.

  **Startup (`@objectstack/cli`, `@objectstack/runtime`)**

  - `messaging` is now a foundational capability. On `objectstack serve` it is
    added to `ALWAYS_ON_CAPABILITIES` (every non-`minimal` preset starts it); on
    cloud per-project kernels the capability loader expands `requires` to add
    `messaging` whenever `audit` is present. This keeps collaboration `@mention` /
    assignment notifications (which now flow through the pipeline) working out of
    the box on both paths. `--preset minimal` opts out.

  The Console bell repoint (objectui) and phases P1–P3 are tracked in
  `docs/handoff/adr-0030-notification-convergence.md`.
