### Patch Changes

- 2e836de: chore(packaging): CHANGELOG.md ships in every npm tarball (#4261)

  The AGENTS.md post-task checklist requires breaking changesets to carry their
  FROM → TO migration because "this text ships to consumers as `CHANGELOG.md`
  inside the npm package and is what an upgrading agent greps after the tombstone
  error." That delivery path was severed for 68 of the 69 publishable packages:
  npm packs `package.json` / `README*` / `LICENSE*` unconditionally but — unlike
  older npm versions — not `CHANGELOG.md`, and the canonical
  `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]` whitelist never named it. Measured on npm
  10.9.7: `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/types` shipped 3 files while its
  70KB `CHANGELOG.md` stayed behind. Only `@objectstack/spec` listed it
  explicitly.

  The tombstone-error scenario is precisely the one where the repo is out of
  reach — the upgrading agent has `node_modules` and nothing else — so the
  migration text has to ride in the tarball. Every publishable package now
  declares `CHANGELOG.md` in `files`, and the canonical whitelist is
  `["dist", "README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]`.

  The other half is the gate: `check:published-files` gains a fifth invariant,
  COMPLETE — a whitelist that fails to cover `CHANGELOG.md` fails the
  always-required lint job, so the next package cannot silently sever the path
  again. `@objectstack/spec`'s per-package EXTRA_ENTRIES exemption dissolves
  into the canonical set.

  Consumer-visible change: one more file per install (the package's changelog,
  e.g. 70.8KB for `@objectstack/types`), and `grep -r "removed key"
node_modules/@objectstack/*/CHANGELOG.md` now finds the migration it was
  promised.

- b5f9397: fix(sharing,runtime): a `sort` passed straight to the engine never ordered anything; migrate every in-repo engine call to canonical QueryAST keys (#4346)

  Two changes with different weights, from one sweep of every in-repo engine
  call site that still speaks a deprecated alias.

  **The bug — three dropped sorts.** #4346 made the engine fold `filter`→`where`
  and `top`→`limit` on all six methods. The other four pairs in
  `RPC_QUERY_ALIAS_SLOTS` (`select`, `sort`, `skip`, `populate`) are folded at
  the RPC/wire layer only — their values need shape lowering that belongs to
  those layers — and a **direct `engine.find()` never crosses that layer**. Three
  call sites passed `sort` there, so it rode onto the AST untouched, every
  driver's `Array.isArray(query.orderBy)` guard declined to emit an ORDER BY, and
  the query returned an ordinary-looking, arbitrarily-ordered result:

  | call site                           | asked for                                         | actually got                |
  | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
  | `share-link-routes.ts`              | shared AI conversation messages, `created_at asc` | messages in arbitrary order |
  | `runtime/domains/share-links.ts`    | same route, runtime-domain copy                   | same                        |
  | `share-link-service.ts` `listLinks` | the 200 most recent share links                   | an arbitrary 200            |

  All three combine the dropped sort with a `limit` — the "latest N" shape whose
  failure #4226 spelled out: an unapplied sort returns rows in arbitrary order,
  which `limit` then slices into an arbitrary page. #4226 fixed that in the wire
  normalizer; these calls sit one layer below it. `listLinks` had no test at all,
  which is why it went unnoticed. Now pinned — on the option bag the engine
  receives, not on row order, because the failure is that the key never becomes
  `orderBy` and a fake engine honouring either spelling would pass either way.

  **The cleanup — 27 no-op renames.** Every remaining in-repo engine call passing
  `filter` now passes `where` (approvals 5, auth 2, reports 6, sharing 11,
  webhooks 2, plus the one `filters` in a spec doc example). These are strict
  no-ops since #4346 folds the alias — the point is that the framework stops
  depending on a spelling it asks users to migrate off, which is a prerequisite
  for ever retiring the aliases. Service-level `filter` PARAMETERS (each
  service's own public API, e.g. `listRequests(filter)`) are deliberately
  untouched — those are not engine option bags.

  Two of the renamed calls were live victims of the #4346 bug rather than
  cosmetic: `auth-manager`'s `stampIdentitySource` read the table's first row via
  `findOne({filter})` and counted the whole table via `count({filter})`, so a
  federated sign-in never stamped `source: 'idp_provisioned'`. #4346 already
  corrected the behaviour; this makes the call say what it means.

- cc2de0e: chore(packaging): 20 packages stop publishing their sources, tests and build tooling (#4248)

  These 20 packages declared no `files` field, so npm fell back to packing the
  whole package directory. `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/plugin-webhooks`
  listed **21 files** — 15 under `src/`, three of them unit tests
  (`auto-enqueuer.test.ts`, `bootstrap-declared-webhooks.test.ts`, …), plus the
  build-time `scripts/i18n-extract.config.ts`. `dist/` lands on top of that at
  publish time rather than instead of it, so consumers were installing the
  TypeScript sources and the test suite alongside the artifact they asked for.

  Each now declares `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]`, matching the 29 packages
  that already did. Nothing a consumer imports moves: every `main` / `types` /
  `exports` target in all 20 already resolved inside `dist/`, which the new
  `check:published-files` guard verifies rather than assumes. The visible change
  is a smaller install and a smaller dependency-scanning surface — `npm pack` on
  `@objectstack/plugin-webhooks` now yields 2 files plus `dist/`.

  The other half of the fix is the gate. Half the packages declaring `files` and
  half not was the #3786 shape — a hand-copied convention with nothing enforcing
  it, where whoever forgets the line gets no signal at all. `check:published-files`
  (new, wired into the always-required `lint` job) holds every non-private
  workspace package to four invariants: `files` is **declared**; it is
  **sufficient** (covers every entry point, so tightening a whitelist cannot ship
  a package that fails to resolve); it is **minimal** (admits no test, test-harness
  config or build script); and anything beyond `dist` + `README.md` is
  **registered** with a reason, reconciled in both directions so a stale exemption
  is an error rather than dead text. `@objectstack/spec` is the one package with
  registered extras — its `.zod.ts` sources, JSON Schemas, liveness ledgers and
  `CHANGELOG.md` are product, not build input.

  This also closes an assumption #4206 was resting on. Excluding `<pkg>/scripts/**`
  from the docs-drift implementation test is sound only while no package publishes
  `scripts/` as runtime code; that held, but it held because someone read all three
  offenders by hand. It is now checked on every PR.

### Major Changes

- 4ed7ed4: feat(security)!: the export axis is now OPT-IN, explainable, and covers reports (#3544, #3710)

  **BREAKING — `allowExport` unset no longer means "inherit read".** Reading a
  record and taking a bulk machine-readable copy of the whole table are different
  privileges (Salesforce "Export Reports", Dynamics "Export to Excel", NetSuite
  "Export Lists", SAP `S_GUI` 61 all separate them). The axis now says so.

  ### Migration — FROM → TO

  |                      | before                              | after                      |
  | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
  | `allowExport` unset  | export **allowed** (inherited read) | export **denied**          |
  | `allowExport: false` | export denied                       | export denied (unchanged)  |
  | `allowExport: true`  | export allowed                      | export allowed (unchanged) |

  **The one-line fix:** add `allowExport: true` to the object entry (or the `'*'`
  wildcard) of every permission set whose holders should keep exporting.

  ```ts
  objects: {
    deal: { allowRead: true, allowExport: true },   // ← add the grant
  }
  ```

  Nothing else changes: read, CRUD, RLS, FLS and sharing are untouched, and a set
  that never exported is unaffected.

  **Who is affected.** Package-shipped sets are re-seeded on upgrade, so the
  built-ins are handled for you — `admin_full_access` and `organization_admin` now
  carry `allowExport: true` explicitly. **Environment-authored sets are not**: any
  custom set whose users export must be edited. `member_default` deliberately does
  NOT carry the grant, so ordinary authenticated users lose export until an admin
  grants it — that is the point of the flip, not an oversight.

  **Merge semantics.** Most-permissive, exactly like the CRUD bits: any set
  granting `true` grants export. `false` and unset are the same outcome; `false`
  is authoring intent, not a veto, because permission sets are additive capability
  containers (ADR-0090).

  **Not implied by super-user bits.** `viewAllRecords` / `modifyAllRecords` no
  longer confer export. Separating "may see all data" from "may take a bulk copy"
  is the segregation-of-duties case the axis exists for.

  ### Also in this change

  - **spec** — a set carrying `allowExport` is now **high-privilege**
    (`describeHighPrivilegeBits`), so it cannot be bound to the `everyone` /
    `guest` audience anchors. Without this the opt-in was defeatable by binding an
    export-granting set to `everyone`. One predicate, so the runtime anchor gate,
    the `@objectstack/lint` security-posture rule and the install-time suggestion
    surface all pick it up together.
  - **spec / plugin-security** — `ExplainOperationSchema` gains `export`, so
    `explain` can answer _why_ a caller got `403 EXPORT_NOT_PERMITTED`. It
    explains as `read ∧ the export grant`: `object_crud` reports the conjunction
    and attributes the granting set, while every data-shaped layer
    (requiredPermissions, OWD/depth/sharing, RLS, record attribution) is computed
    as the `find` the export actually performs — asking the RLS compiler about an
    `export` operation would match no policy and wrongly report "no RLS applies".
    `readFilter` is surfaced for `export` as it is for `read`.
  - **plugin-reports** — closes the reports side door (#3710). A report rendered
    as `csv`/`json` is the same bulk copy of the same object, so it is gated by
    the same `ISecurityService.canExport`. Enforced in `executeReport`, which the
    interactive run, the ad-hoc run and the scheduled dispatch all funnel through;
    `scheduleReport` additionally refuses at create time so an author is not told
    at 3am. A schedule created while granted stops delivering once the grant is
    revoked. `html_table` stays a read — it is a rendered view, not a bulk copy.
    Deployments without `plugin-security` are unaffected (no permission sets
    exist, so the axis does not apply).

### Patch Changes

- f531a26: fix(security): close three execution-surface authz holes surfaced by the #2849 class sweep (#2980, #2981, #2982)

  Three independent, confirmed-exploitable defects where an execution surface
  ignored the caller's identity or fell open on a missing one. Each is fixed at
  its own enforcement point; none change behaviour for correctly-scoped callers.

  - **#2980 — reports IDOR + scheduled-report RLS bypass.** `ReportService`
    discarded the caller's context and read/wrote `sys_saved_report` with a system
    context, so any authenticated user could read, delete, or overwrite any saved
    report by id (cross-owner / cross-tenant), and `listReports` enumerated all
    owners. `getReport`/`deleteReport`/`saveReport`/`listReports` are now
    owner-scoped (system read of the protection-locked metadata object, but
    authorization enforced by owner match); create/overwrite can no longer spoof
    ownership. Scheduled dispatch no longer runs `isSystem` (which emailed the
    target object's entire table past the owner's RLS): it resolves the owner to a
    real RLS-bearing context via a new `resolveOwnerContext` seam and **fails
    closed** (skips + marks the schedule failed) when the owner can't be resolved,
    rather than running elevated. Wiring that resolver is the reports-surface
    consumer of ADR-0073's user-less identity resolution.

  - **#2981 — knowledge/RAG retrieval fall-open.** `applyPermissionFilter` returned
    every hit when the context was missing _or_ system. A missing identity is no
    longer treated as a grant: object-backed hits fail closed (dropped, keeping
    ACL-less file/http hits), and only an **explicit** system context passes
    through. Closes the agent path where an omitted `ToolExecutionContext.actor`
    yielded unfiltered semantic search over the whole corpus.

  - **#2982 — bulk-write OWD gap.** `update({multi:true})` / `deleteMany` had no
    single id to `canEdit`-gate, so owner scoping was skipped on private (and
    public_read) objects. A new `SharingService.buildWriteFilter` (the edit-set
    analogue of `buildReadFilter`) is AND-ed into the write AST for multi writes,
    constraining them to rows the caller may edit — including the on-behalf-of
    delegator intersection.

  Tracked as the motivating evidence of ADR-0096 (execution-surface identity
  admission); the mechanism that would prevent the class structurally is separate.

### Patch Changes

- 607aaf4: 导出文件名本地化 + 系统字段标签内置多语言回退。

  **`@objectstack/rest` — 导出下载文件名**:`GET /data/:object/export` 的 `Content-Disposition` 不再是裸的 `<对象名>.<扩展名>`,改为「对象显示名-时间戳」:ASCII 兜底用 API 名(`filename="contracts-20260714-153045.xlsx"`),本地化标签(如中文)按 RFC 5987/6266 编码进 `filename*=UTF-8''…`(浏览器直接下载得到 `合同-20260714-153045.xlsx`)。新增导出 `exportContentDisposition(objectName, label, ext, now?)`。

  **`@objectstack/spec` — 系统字段标签回退**:ObjectQL 注册表给每个对象注入的系统字段(`owner_id`/`created_at`/`created_by`/`updated_at`/`updated_by`)只带英文标签,自定义对象又没有对应的翻译条目,导致中文界面的列表表头、导出文件、导入模板里漏出 "Owner"/"Created At" 等英文。`translateObject` 现内置这五个字段的 en/zh-CN/ja-JP/es-ES 标签表(措辞与平台生成的翻译包一致),仅当字段仍是注入的英文默认值时套用——作者自定义的标签绝不覆盖;无翻译包时也生效(`translateObject` 不再因缺 bundle 而提前返回,REST 元数据翻译路径同步放宽,缓存 ETag 本就按 locale 分键,无缓存串味风险)。

  **`@objectstack/plugin-reports` — 附件文件名**:定时报表附件的文件名清洗从「非 ASCII 全部替换成 `_`」改为按 Unicode 字母/数字保留(`\p{L}\p{N}`),中文计划名不再变成一串下划线。

  **`@objectstack/rest` — 导入接受翻译后的选项标签(导出 ↔ 导入闭环)**:导出与导入模板写出的是*翻译后*的选项标签(如 `待规划`),但导入强制转换只认作者原始 schema 的标签/值,导致用户把自己刚导出的本地化文件原样导回时 select 字段全部报 `invalid_option`。`prepareImportRequest` 新增 `localizeSchema` 钩子(REST 导入路由传入 `translateMetaItem`),把当前 locale 的翻译标签合并进字段选项作为匹配同义词——作者标签与选项 code 照常匹配,非法值照常报错,翻译失败时降级为仅作者标签匹配。新增导出 `mergeLocalizedOptionSynonyms(metaMap, localizedMetaMap)`。

### Minor Changes

- d42004b: feat(reports): report schedules honor `cron_expression` + `timezone`

  `sys_report_schedule` has long carried `cron_expression` and `timezone` fields, but `ReportService` only ever advanced `next_run_at` by `interval_minutes` — both fields were stored and ignored. Scheduling now computes `next_run_at` from the cron expression (when present) in the schedule's timezone via `croner` — the same library the job scheduler uses — so "every weekday at 09:00 local" is expressible. `interval_minutes` remains the fallback.

  - `cron_expression` wins over `interval_minutes` when set (the field's documented contract).
  - Evaluated in `timezone` (default `UTC`).
  - `scheduleReport` validates the cron expression eagerly and rejects an invalid one with `VALIDATION_FAILED`, rather than silently falling back at sweep time. A cron that becomes unschedulable later is logged and falls back to the interval — it never throws into the dispatch sweep.

  The DB-polling dispatch model is unchanged; only the next-run computation is cron-aware. Part of ADR-0053 Phase 2 (#1983) but self-contained — report schedules run under a system context, so the timezone source is the schedule's own field, independent of the reference-timezone resolver.
