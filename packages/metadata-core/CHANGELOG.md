### Major Changes

- 65f184b: fix(metadata)!: `sys_metadata_history.recorded_by` stores NULL, not the sentinel string `'system'` (#4556)

  `recorded_by` is declared `Field.lookup('sys_user', { readonly: true })` — a
  foreign key. The write path filled it with `actor ?? 'system'`, so every
  metadata write without a caller actor (boot sync, migration, an internal call)
  stored the **string** `'system'` in a column whose declared type says "the id
  of a `sys_user` row". No such row exists, and `SystemUserId.SYSTEM`
  (`'usr_system'`) is not auto-provisioned on the current runtime either, so the
  value resolved to nothing under any reading. Any consumer that read the field
  by its declaration — `expand`, an owner column in a report, an audit timeline
  showing "who changed this" — got an id that could not be dereferenced.

  It had already cost twice. #4441 had to exempt every `readonly` field from the
  write-path referential-integrity check, because otherwise ordinary metadata
  authoring (package create / publish / clone) was rejected. #4551's
  dangling-reference audit had to skip the same set for the same reason. The
  field ended up the platform's only reference column that is neither enforced
  nor audited.

  **The fix is on the write path, not the declaration.** `recorded_by` stays a
  `lookup('sys_user')`; an actor-less write now stores `NULL`, and `NULL` means
  "system-initiated (boot sync, migration, scheduled job)" — the standard
  expression of "no link", and already what this column's `set_null` delete
  behaviour means. No magic system-user account (a row that can never sign in yet
  holds an identity is a new security surface), and no `actor_kind` companion
  column.

  **Breaking — the repository contract is now explicitly nullable.**

  | Surface                                   | Before   | After                                 |
  | :---------------------------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------ |
  | `PutOptions.actor`, `DeleteOptions.actor` | `string` | `string \| null` (still **required**) |
  | `MetadataEvent.actor`                     | `string` | `string \| null`                      |
  | `MetadataItem.authoredBy`                 | `string` | `string \| null`                      |

  `actor` stays required rather than becoming optional on purpose: every call
  site must state which of the two it is, so a forgotten actor cannot silently
  become a fake foreign key. Migrating a caller:

  - **Writers** — passing a real identity: unchanged. Passing `'system'`, `''`,
    or a label to satisfy the type: pass `null` instead.
  - **Readers** — `event.actor` and `item.authoredBy` can be `null`. Handle it at
    the point of display (`actor ?? 'System'` in a UI string is fine — the fix is
    that the _stored_ value no longer lies, not that no label may ever be shown).

  Two read paths also stopped inventing a value: `SysMetadataRepository.history()`
  and `getByHash()` rendered an absent actor as the string `'unknown'`, which is
  indistinguishable from a real user id to anything that resolves the field. They
  now surface `null`.

  **Existing rows: `os migrate recorded-by`.** The stored `'system'` values are
  rewritten to `NULL` by a new command, which runs the conversion through the
  ADR-0119 D2 migration journal (chunk-atomic, resumable via `os migrate resume`).
  It is a dry run by default and safe to re-run — it selects only rows still
  holding the sentinel, so a second `--apply` converts nothing.

  The rewrite is **semantically equivalent, not a reinterpretation**: this column
  has only ever held that one sentinel, written by exactly one expression
  (`actor ?? 'system'`), and both spellings mean "no actor" — only `NULL` is
  expressible in the declared type.

  Deliberately unchanged: `sys_metadata_audit.actor` is a `text` column whose
  declaration already says "user id, system id, or `'system'`", so its `'system'`
  default is honest and stays. The #4441 `readonly` narrowing and the #4551 audit
  skip also stay — see the PR for why they are still correct.

- ce92674: feat(spec)!: retire the standalone `validation` metadata kind (#4509, ADR-0088)

  A validation rule authored as its own artifact bound to nothing and gated no
  write. `ValidationRuleSchema` carries **no object-binding key** — no `object`,
  no `objectName` — and all six variants are `strictObject`, so an author could
  not supply one either. No merge step existed. The only code that expected such a
  key was a reference-tracker row scanning a field the schema would have stripped.
  Meanwhile the engine evaluates exactly one shape: the object's own
  `validations[]` array, on insert and on every matched update row.

  So a rule created through the standalone door — a `*.validation.ts` file, or
  Studio's Validations list — parsed, saved, reported success, and intercepted
  nothing. Including a `state_machine` rule, which ADR-0020 routes through this
  same vocabulary: an author could believe they had locked down record state
  transitions and have changed nothing at all.

  Under ADR-0088 the kind fails the admission test on its first clause: a rule has
  no independent lifecycle, because it only means something against an object. And
  unlike the sibling disconnects closed in this batch, it could not be bridged into
  one — the shape has nowhere to name its object.

  **The rule vocabulary is untouched.** `ValidationRuleSchema` and all six
  variants are unchanged and fully live; the engine's evaluation path is not
  modified by this change. It is the _kind_ that was inert, not the schema. The
  liveness ledger keeps governing it through the gate's `SPEC_ONLY_SCHEMAS`
  override (alongside `webhook` and `query`), because an ungoverned live schema is
  exactly how the next drift would hide.

  **Migration.** Move the rule into the owning object's `validations:` array — the
  rule body is identical, same schema, same six variants:

  ```ts
  // before — a standalone *.validation.ts, which never ran
  export default defineValidation({ name: 'amount_positive', type: 'script', … })

  // after — on the object, where rules are evaluated
  ObjectSchema.create({
    name: 'invoice',
    validations: [{ name: 'amount_positive', type: 'script', … }],
  })
  ```

  Removed: the registry entry (and its `*.validation.ts` / `*.validation.yml`
  patterns), the `MetadataTypeSchema` member, the metadata-core lockstep enum
  member, the schema-map entry, the create seed, Studio's Validations nav item and
  its hand-crafted form, and the dangling reference-tracker row. Standalone rows
  already in `sys_metadata` are left alone — they were never evaluated, so nothing
  changes behaviorally.

### Minor Changes

- f5a4ef0: refactor!: ADR-0112 batch 2 — sweep the lowercase error-code emitters (#4003)

  Continues #3841 per ADR-0112. Batch 1 (#3988) settled the vocabulary and closed
  the set; this batch moves the emitters that still spoke lowercase `snake_case`
  onto it.

  **Wire-visible change.** Error codes on these surfaces change spelling. Generic
  conditions collapse onto the standard catalog rather than keeping a synonym:
  `unauthorized`/`unauthenticated` → `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `forbidden` →
  `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `not_found` → `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `internal` →
  `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `unavailable` → `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, `not_supported` →
  `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `bad_request` → `INVALID_REQUEST`. Domain conditions get codes
  registered in `ERROR_CODE_LEDGER` (`MARKETPLACE_STORAGE_FAILED`,
  `PLUGIN_MANIFEST_INVALID`, `ITEM_LOCKED`, `DELIVERY_NOT_ELIGIBLE`, …). Swept:
  `cloud-connection`, `plugin-auth`, `hono`, `metadata-protocol`, `rest`,
  `service-messaging`, `service-automation`, `trigger-api`.

  Branch on `error.code` values rather than pattern-matching their case: the
  console's fix for the same rename (objectui#2977) reads codes case-insensitively
  for exactly this reason, and that is the pattern to copy in your own consumers if
  you support servers on both sides of the change.

  **Four routes stop putting a code in the message slot.** The webhook redeliver
  route, the API-trigger webhook, and two `rest` routes answered
  `{ success: false, error: '<code>', message }` — the code occupying `error`, the
  declared object envelope nowhere. They now emit `error: { code, message }`, and
  three API-trigger branches gained a message they never had. Clients reading
  `body.error` as a string on those routes must read `body.error.code`.

  **`ConnectorErrorCategory` / `ConnectorRetryStrategy`** (ADR-0112 D9a):
  `@objectstack/spec` exported two mutually incompatible `ErrorCategory` types and
  two `RetryStrategy` types. The connector-side pair is renamed; importers of the
  `integration` subpath update the name. Side effect: the api-side `ErrorCategory`
  and `RetryStrategy` now appear in the generated API reference at all — the name
  collision had been silently dropping them.

  **`OAUTH_REGISTER_FAILED` replaces an unbounded code source.** The OAuth client
  registration route put better-auth's arbitrary `body.error` string straight into
  `error.code`. The code is now ours and the upstream discriminator moved to
  `details.upstreamError`.

  **Not swept, deliberately.** `sys_metadata_audit.code` keeps its lowercase values
  (ADR-0112 D6b): it is persisted audit history, and the same column holds
  non-error outcomes (`ok`, `lock_override`). Diagnostics records that ship inside a
  200 keep theirs (D6c), as do field-level codes (D6, #3977) and the CLI's
  `--json` output contract.

  A `check:error-code-casing` CI guard now fails on a new lowercase literal in a
  code position, since the ledger's casing rule can only police codes that someone
  registers.

### Patch Changes

- 2e836de: chore(packaging): CHANGELOG.md ships in every npm tarball (#4261)

  The AGENTS.md post-task checklist requires breaking changesets to carry their
  FROM → TO migration because "this text ships to consumers as `CHANGELOG.md`
  inside the npm package and is what an upgrading agent greps after the tombstone
  error." That delivery path was severed for 68 of the 69 publishable packages:
  npm packs `package.json` / `README*` / `LICENSE*` unconditionally but — unlike
  older npm versions — not `CHANGELOG.md`, and the canonical
  `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]` whitelist never named it. Measured on npm
  10.9.7: `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/types` shipped 3 files while its
  70KB `CHANGELOG.md` stayed behind. Only `@objectstack/spec` listed it
  explicitly.

  The tombstone-error scenario is precisely the one where the repo is out of
  reach — the upgrading agent has `node_modules` and nothing else — so the
  migration text has to ride in the tarball. Every publishable package now
  declares `CHANGELOG.md` in `files`, and the canonical whitelist is
  `["dist", "README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]`.

  The other half is the gate: `check:published-files` gains a fifth invariant,
  COMPLETE — a whitelist that fails to cover `CHANGELOG.md` fails the
  always-required lint job, so the next package cannot silently sever the path
  again. `@objectstack/spec`'s per-package EXTRA_ENTRIES exemption dissolves
  into the canonical set.

  Consumer-visible change: one more file per install (the package's changelog,
  e.g. 70.8KB for `@objectstack/types`), and `grep -r "removed key"
node_modules/@objectstack/*/CHANGELOG.md` now finds the migration it was
  promised.

### Patch Changes

- db48ad5: fix(security,approvals,metadata-core): restore batch routes on the eight objects the #3391 P1 companion fix missed (#3026)

  The #3391 P1 contract made the bulk gate `bulk ∧ derived(child)`: a batch
  request is admitted only when the object grants the `bulk` **primitive** and the
  batched child operation is itself allowed. Before that, the `*Many` routes
  checked only the child verb, so a boilerplate CRUD-five whitelist
  (`['get','list','create','update','delete']`) batched fine.

  The companion fix — adding the `bulk` primitive wherever an explicit whitelist
  survived — was applied only inside `platform-objects`. Eight objects carrying
  the same boilerplate live in other packages and kept the gap, so `/batch`,
  `createMany`, `updateMany` and `deleteMany` answered `405
OBJECT_API_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` on objects whose single-record create/update/
  delete were wide open. `data-objectstack` rethrows that 405 without falling back
  to per-row writes, which surfaced as a hard error on multi-select delete in the
  Setup grids.

  Objects reclaimed (whitelist now `['get','list','create','update','delete','bulk']`):
  `sys_capability`, `sys_permission_set`, `sys_position`,
  `sys_position_permission_set`, `sys_user_permission_set`, `sys_user_position`
  (plugin-security); `sys_approval_delegation` (plugin-approvals);
  `sys_view_definition` (metadata-core).

  No new authority is granted: `bulk` only permits batching verbs each object
  already exposes one record at a time, and every batched row still passes the
  same row- and field-level permission checks. The whitelists stay explicit rather
  than being deleted — seven of the eight are `managedBy`, and
  `reconcileManagedApiMethods` (ADR-0103 D3) early-returns on a non-array
  `apiMethods`, so dropping the line would silently disable the managed-write
  backstop.

- c073b8c: refactor(metadata-core): drop `sys_view_definition`'s all-six `apiMethods` whitelist (#3026)

  #3745 completed this object's boilerplate CRUD-five whitelist to all six
  primitives so its batch routes stopped 405-ing. A whitelist naming all six is
  equivalent to no whitelist — except it stops tracking primitives the enum grows
  later — so the #3543 audit rule applies and the declaration is removed.

  No behaviour change: `undefined` resolves to `unrestricted`, whose effective
  operation set is identical to `restricted` holding all six.

  Removing it is safe HERE specifically because the object has no `managedBy`:
  `reconcileManagedApiMethods` (ADR-0103 D3) early-returns on a non-array
  `apiMethods`, so for a managed object an absent whitelist would take the
  managed-write backstop with it. That is why the RBAC objects reclaimed by #3745
  keep their explicit arrays and this one does not.

### Patch Changes

- 62a2117: **Split the overloaded `managedBy: 'system'` bucket with an explicit `engine-owned` value (ADR-0103 addendum, #3343).** ADR-0103 deferred the enum split ("revisitable later as a rename") because a new `managedBy` value would fall through to the fully-editable `platform` default on deployed Console clients. Both reasons against it are now retired — the server-side write guard / `apiMethods` reconciliation / `/me/permissions` clamp make that fallthrough cosmetic (the write is rejected regardless of what the client renders), and objectui#2712 closed the UI union — so v16 lands it, **additively**.

  - **New enum value `engine-owned`** with the same all-locked default affordance row as `system` (`create/import/edit/delete: false`, `exportCsv: true`). It joins `ENGINE_OWNED_BUCKETS` (the engine write guard) and `GUARDED_WRITE_BUCKETS` (the `/me/permissions` clamp); the guard, `reconcileManagedApiMethods`, and the clamp mechanisms are unchanged — `engine-owned` is an explicit member of the set they already covered by resolved affordance.
  - **20 objects relabelled `system → engine-owned`** — the ones the engine owns end to end and that declared no write-opening `userActions` (the metadata store, jobs, approval runtime rows, sharing rows, `sys_automation_run`, the messaging delivery/receipt pipeline, `sys_secret`, settings). One-line, behaviour-identical per object.
  - **8 admin/user-writable objects keep `managedBy: 'system'`** (the RBAC link tables, `sys_user_preference`, `sys_approval_delegation`, the messaging config grids) — `system` now reads as "engine-managed schema, writable via `userActions`".

  Behaviour-, enforcement- and wire-identical: resolved affordances, the guard verdict, the 405 `apiMethods` reconciliation, and the permissions clamp are the same before and after — this is a self-documenting relabel, not a policy change. No data migration (`managedBy` is schema metadata) and no code branches on the `'system'` literal. Retiring the overloaded `system` entirely (moving the 8 writable objects to a dedicated bucket) is a breaking rename deferred to v17.

- 06cb319: fix(identity): close the generic-write apiMethods hole on sys_presence and sys_metadata (#3220)

  Follow-through on #1591/#3213 (better-auth apiMethods reconciliation) for two
  non-better-auth managed objects that shipped the same contradiction: their
  `enable.apiMethods` advertised generic `create`/`update`/`delete` while their
  `managedBy` bucket forbids user-context writes, leaving the generic `/data`
  route open to a write the bucket does not permit.

  - `sys_presence` (`managedBy: 'append-only'`) advertised `create`/`update`/`delete`
    (update/delete on an append-only object at that) but is written only over the
    realtime websocket/in-memory path, never through ObjectQL. Narrowed to
    `['get', 'list']`.
  - `sys_metadata` (`managedBy: 'system'`) advertised full CRUD but customization
    overlays are authored only through the metadata-protocol RPC (engine writes
    carry a transaction context, not a user session); neither the framework nor
    the Console (objectui) POSTs `/data/sys_metadata`. Narrowed to `['get', 'list']`.

  Reads stay open. The metadata-protocol / realtime write paths are engine-level
  and bypass the HTTP exposure gate, so they are unaffected — verified by the
  metadata-authoring dogfood and the objectql overlay tests.

  A blast-radius audit confirmed the broader `system`/`append-only` buckets are NOT
  safe to guard wholesale: several `system` objects (`sys_user_position`,
  `sys_user_permission_set`, `sys_position_permission_set`, `sys_user_preference`,
  `sys_import_job`) are legitimately user-writable by design (delegated
  administration, user preferences, imports). Generalizing the engine write guard
  to those buckets is intentionally NOT done here — see #3220 for the bucket-taxonomy
  root cause.

### Minor Changes

- 7953832: ADR-0057 data lifecycle P1–P4 (#2786): platform-generated data is now bounded by construction.

  - **P1 — contract**: new `lifecycle` object property (`class: record | audit | telemetry | transient | event` + `retention` / `ttl` / `storage(rotation)` / `archive` / `reclaim`), enforced by the platform-owned **LifecycleService** registered by `ObjectQLPlugin` (default-on; disable via `OS_LIFECYCLE_DISABLED=1` or plugin `lifecycle.enabled=false`). The Reaper batch-deletes rows past `retention.maxAge` / `ttl` under a system context and reclaims space (`SqlDriver.reclaimSpace()` → SQLite `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum`). Non-`record` classes must declare a bounding policy (parse-time invariant + spec-liveness gate + dogfood storage-growth gate).
  - **P2 — rotation**: `storage: { strategy: 'rotation', shards, unit }` physically time-shards the table on SQLite — writes land in the current shard, reads go through a UNION-ALL view under the base name, expiry is an O(1) `DROP` of shards past the window. A legacy table is adopted as the first shard on upgrade. Other dialects fall back to an equivalent age-based reap.
  - **P3 — separation + Archiver**: registering a datasource named `telemetry` routes telemetry/event/audit objects to it (opt-in by existence; `transient` deliberately stays on the primary). Audit objects with `archive` declared get retain → archive → delete once the archive datasource exists; without it rows are retained, never dropped unarchived.
  - **P4 — governance**: new `lifecycle` settings namespace — runtime enable switch, per-object retention overrides (tenant-scoped: regulated tenants set years, dev sets days), per-object/per-class row quotas and growth alerts (observe-and-alert only).

  **Behavior change**: 11 platform objects now carry lifecycle declarations and their telemetry is bounded by default — `sys_activity` 14d (rotated), `sys_audit_log` 90d hot → archive (retained forever until an `archive` datasource is registered), `sys_metadata_audit` 365d → archive, `sys_job_run` / `sys_automation_run` / `sys_http_delivery` 30d, notification pipeline (`sys_notification`, delivery, receipt, inbox) 90d, `sys_device_code` expires_at + 1d. Extend windows per environment/tenant via the `lifecycle.retention_overrides` setting.

### Minor Changes

- 60dc3ba: ADR-0087 P0 — enforce the protocol version handshake (make `engines.protocol` real).

  `PluginEnginesSchema.protocol` (ADR-0025 §3.2, protocol-first per §3.10 #3) was declared, documented, and checked by no loader or installer — an ADR-0078 "declarable-but-inert" violation. A package built against an incompatible protocol major failed deep in a schema `.parse()` or a renderer contract instead of at the boundary.

  - **`@objectstack/spec`**: exports `PROTOCOL_VERSION` / `PROTOCOL_MAJOR` (`kernel`) — the single source of truth the handshake checks against. A drift test keeps it in lockstep with the package major.
  - **`@objectstack/metadata-core`**: adds `checkProtocolCompat()` (pure, major-grained range check), `assertProtocolCompat()`, and the structured `ProtocolIncompatibleError` (`OS_PROTOCOL_INCOMPATIBLE`, carrying both versions and the `objectstack migrate meta --from N` command). It refuses only on a _positive_ mismatch determination; absent ranges are grandfathered (warn) and unrecognized ranges never cause a false rejection.
  - **`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`**: `installPackage` runs the handshake before writing to the registry — an incompatible package is refused with a machine-actionable diagnostic instead of crashing later.

  Additive and backward compatible: packages that declare no `engines.protocol` range keep loading (with a warning). Part of the ADR-0087 epic (#2643); resolves #2644.

### Minor Changes

- da807f7: feat(spec)!: retire the placeholder metadata kinds `trigger`, `router`, `function`, `service` (ADR-0088).

  The registry is the contract authors — human and AI — read to learn what can be authored, and these four kinds had no authoring surface, no loader, no schema, and no (or a dead) consumer. `MetadataTypeSchema` + `DEFAULT_METADATA_TYPE_REGISTRY` shrink 30 → 26; `OPS_FILE_SUFFIX_REGEX` drops the four suffixes; the dormant objectql load path that registered QL functions from `type: 'function'` metadata items is removed (`defineStack({ functions })` / plugin `contributes.functions` remain the delivered forms); the metadata-core lockstep enum follows. `external_catalog` stays and is now annotated RUNTIME-CREATED (ADR-0062): its lack of an authoring surface is correct design. The delivered replacements: `hook` / `record_change` flows (trigger), plugin `contributes.routes` + declarative `apis:` (router), `defineStack({ functions })` (function), the plugin/service registry (service). Persisted `sys_metadata` rows are unaffected — no production read path re-parses stored `type` values through the enum.

### Minor Changes

- 4d99a5c: Package-scoped commit history & rollback for AI authoring (ADR-0067)

  Each authoring apply now lands as one revertible **commit** on a package timeline, on top of `sys_metadata_history`:

  - New `sys_metadata_commit` object groups a turn's metadata changes (by `event_seq` range).
  - `publishPackageDrafts` records each publish as one commit (best-effort) with a per-artifact revert plan and an optional `message` / `aiModel`.
  - New protocol methods `listCommits`, `revertCommit`, `rollbackToPackageCommit` (reusing `restoreVersion` + delete; a revert is itself an append-only commit).
  - New REST routes: `GET /packages/:id/commits`, `POST /packages/:id/commits/:commitId/revert`, `POST /packages/:id/rollback`.

### Minor Changes

- fef38ec: feat(metadata): package-scoped customization overlays (ADR-0048 #1824)

  A `sys_metadata` customization overlay is now keyed by `(type, name,
organization_id, package_id)`, so two installed packages shipping an item of the
  same `type`/`name` can each carry their **own** overlay. Previously the overlay
  uniqueness key was `(type, name, organization_id)` — physically one row per
  name — so customizing one package's item shadowed both, and a package-scoped
  read fell back to whichever row existed.

  - **Index**: `idx_sys_metadata_overlay_active` / `…_draft` now include
    `package_id`. The runtime migration (`ensureOverlayIndex`) uses
    `COALESCE(package_id, '')` so package-less (global) overlays stay unique among
    themselves (a plain unique index treats NULLs as distinct). DROP-then-CREATE,
    idempotent; existing rows migrate safely (the old key already guaranteed one
    row per `(type, name, org)`).
  - **Write**: `SysMetadataRepository.whereFor`/`put`/`get` scope the upsert to the
    requested package, so a save bound to package B no longer finds and overwrites
    package A's same-name overlay. A package-less save (`packageId` null) targets
    the global row.
  - **Read**: `getMetaItem` / `getMetaItemLayered` overlay lookups already prefer
    the package-scoped row; the fallback now resolves only the **global**
    (`package_id IS NULL`) overlay, never a _different_ package's row. Package-less
    readers are unchanged (match-any, back-compat).

  Verified live against a real collision (two packages each shipping
  `page/showcase_task_workbench`): two overlay rows coexist, and `?package=` single
  reads + the `?layers=true` Studio editor view each return that package's own
  overlay; the unique index migrated in place.

  Known follow-up: the _unscoped list_ (`GET /meta/:type` with no `?package=`)
  still dedupes by bare name, so when two packages both carry an overlay on the
  same name the list collapses them — the per-package single-item and editor paths
  are unaffected. Tracked for the list-dedup-by-name work.

### Patch Changes

- 764c747: fix(metadata): home the metadata-storage objects in metadata-core and register them from ObjectQL

  Standalone "host config" apps boot without `@objectstack/metadata`'s MetadataPlugin, so nobody registered the metadata-storage objects (`sys_metadata`, `_history`, `_audit`, `sys_view_definition`) into ObjectQL — their tables were never schema-synced and ObjectQL's own protocol (`loadMetaFromDb` / `getMetaItems`) failed with `no such table: sys_metadata` on every read.

  - Move the four storage-object definitions from `@objectstack/platform-objects/metadata` to `@objectstack/metadata-core` (the lowest package shared by their real consumers); `platform-objects/metadata` now re-exports them for back-compat.
  - `ObjectQLPlugin` registers these objects itself (gated on `environmentId === undefined`, mirroring `restoreMetadataFromDb`) so their tables always sync on platform/standalone kernels.
  - Gate the SQL driver's tenant-audit warning on actual multi-tenant mode — `organization_id` now exists on every table, so column presence alone no longer implies "tenant-scoped"; single-tenant boots no longer spam the warning for system writes.

### Patch Changes

- bab2b20: feat(approvals): execution-pinned approval processes (ADR-0009)

  When an approval request is submitted, the engine now records a `process_hash`
  on `sys_approval_request` — the sha256 of the approval process body resolved
  through `MetadataRepository`. While the request is in flight, `approve` /
  `reject` / `recall` resolve the pinned process body via
  `MetadataRepository.getByHash`. Upgrading the approval process definition
  mid-flight therefore no longer affects requests that already started against
  the previous version.

  Behavior:

  - `sys_approval_request` gains a `process_hash` column (text, nullable,
    read-only). Existing rows keep working — the engine falls back to the
    current `sys_approval_process` projection when the column is empty.
  - `ApprovalServiceOptions` accepts an optional `metadataRepo`. When omitted
    (e.g. defining processes purely through the runtime API or in unit tests),
    pinning is silently disabled and the service behaves as before.
  - `ApprovalsServicePlugin` looks up the metadata service from the kernel
    and wires its repository automatically.
  - The metadata-core local `MetadataTypeSchema` enum was realigned with the
    canonical `@objectstack/spec/kernel` enum (drift fix: `approval`, `field`,
    `function`, `service`, …).

  This is the first user-visible consumer of the `executionPinned` capability
  introduced in ADR-0009.

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 75f4ee6: feat(metadata): introduce `executionPinned` capability for runtime version pinning (ADR-0009)

  Adds a new capability flag on the metadata type registry so that types whose runtime
  transaction rows reference a specific historical version (flow, workflow, approval)
  get unified pinning behavior — instead of every business table re-implementing its
  own snapshot column.

  - `MetadataTypeRegistryEntrySchema` gains `executionPinned: boolean`, enforced
    invariant `executionPinned ⇒ supportsVersioning`.
  - `flow`, `workflow`, `approval` flipped to `executionPinned: true`. `approval`
    also corrected to `supportsVersioning: true` (it was wrongly `false`).
  - `MetadataRepository.getByHash(ref, hash)` added to the interface. Production
    implementation in `SysMetadataRepository` resolves historical bodies through
    `sys_metadata_history` keyed by `(organization_id, type, name, checksum)`.
    In-memory and FS repositories serve HEAD-only matches.
  - `sys_metadata_history` gains an index on `(organization_id, type, name, checksum)`
    to keep hash lookups O(log n).
  - `HistoryCleanupManager` skips pinned types entirely (both age-based and
    count-based retention) — pinned-type history must never be GC'd.

  See `docs/adr/0009-execution-pinned-metadata.md` for full rationale and the
  list of rejected alternatives (no shared snapshot table, no inlined snapshot column).

## 5.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e9dcb4: **BREAKING — metadata: remove `project` and `branch` from `MetaRef`**

  The metadata layer no longer models project or branch. Customisation is now
  scoped purely to **organisation**. Project remains exclusively as an artifact
  packaging concept (the `objectstack.json` bundle envelope); branching is left
  to Git.

  What changed:

  - `MetaRef` is now `{ org, type, name, version? }` (was
    `{ org, project, branch, type, name, version? }`). `refKey()` is the two
    segment string `${org}/${type}/${name}` (was five segments).
  - `MetadataItem.seq` is monotonic **per org** (was per branch).
  - `BranchRef`, `MergeStrategy`, `MergeResult` types and the optional
    `fork`/`merge` methods on `MetadataRepository` are removed.
  - `ListFilter` / `WatchFilter` / `HistoryOptions` no longer accept `project`
    or `branch`.
  - `FileSystemRepository` disk layout simplified to
    `<root>/<type>/<name>.json` (was `<root>/<project>/<branch>/<type>/<name>.json`);
    change-log path is now `.objectstack/.log/main.jsonl` regardless of any
    branch concept. Constructor no longer accepts `project` / `branch`.
  - `SysMetadataRepository`: removed `projectLabel` / `branchLabel` options;
    the `sys_metadata` schema's `project_id` / `branch` columns (if present)
    are ignored. A future major release will `DROP` them.
  - `MetadataManager.setRepository(repo, opts)` no longer takes an opts object
    with `branch`.

  Migration:

  ```diff
  -const ref = { org: 'acme', project: 'crm', branch: 'main', type: 'view', name: 'home' };
  +const ref = { org: 'acme', type: 'view', name: 'home' };

  -new FileSystemRepository({ root, org: 'acme', project: 'crm', branch: 'main' });
  +new FileSystemRepository({ root, org: 'acme' });
  ```

  Existing `sys_metadata` rows continue to load; the deprecated columns are
  ignored at read time.

- 4150fe4: Add `MetadataCache` — bounded, event-invalidated LRU sitting in front of
  any `MetadataRepository`. Features:

  - Bounded by `maxEntries` and `maxBytes` (default 1024 / 8 MiB).
  - LRU eviction with touch-on-read.
  - Lazy fill on read miss; negative caching for known-absent items.
  - Subscribes to `repo.watch(filter)` and invalidates affected entries
    (including rename: both old and new keys).
  - Coalesces concurrent reads for the same key onto a single backend
    fetch (thundering-herd safe).
  - Generation counter discards in-flight fetches that race an
    invalidation, preventing stale-cache poisoning.
  - Diagnostics via `getStats()` (entries, bytes, hits, misses,
    invalidations, coalesced).

  Includes a property-based test that verifies cache→repo convergence
  under randomly-generated update sequences.

  See ADR-0008 §10 PR-3.

- 8337cdb: Add `InMemoryRepository` (reference implementation) and a parameterised
  Repository contract test suite. The contract suite, exposed at
  `@objectstack/metadata-core/testing`, verifies the seven invariants every
  backend must satisfy (atomic put, monotonic seq per branch, optimistic
  locking, canonical hashing, event ordering, watch resumability,
  tombstones).

  Includes implementation-specific tests covering the injected clock,
  canonical-hash insertion-order independence, and deep-copy isolation
  between caller and store.

  See ADR-0008 §10 PR-2.

- 58835a6: Add `LayeredRepository` — composes N `MetadataRepository`s into a
  read-through stack. Reads walk top-to-bottom; writes route to the
  topmost writable layer; `list()` deduplicates by `refKey` preferring
  the top; `history()` and `watch()` merge events from all layers,
  tagging each event's `source` with `<layer>:<original-source>`. The
  multiplexed `watch()` correctly cancels all child iterators when the
  consumer calls `return()`.

  Enables the canonical "system built-ins under user overlay" pattern
  described in ADR-0008.

  See ADR-0008 §10 PR-5.

- 8cc30b4: New package: Repository contracts for the metadata lifecycle (ADR-0008).

  Definitions only — no I/O. Exports Zod schemas, the
  `MetadataRepository` interface, canonical-form helpers
  (`canonicalize`, `hashSpec`), and typed errors (`ConflictError`,
  `NotFoundError`, `SchemaValidationError`).

  This is M0 PR-1 of the four-layer metadata refactor. Subsequent PRs
  add `InMemoryRepository`, `MetadataCache`, `FileSystemRepository`
  and migrate the existing `MetadataManager` / HMR plumbing onto the
  new contracts.

### Patch Changes

- 32ce912: Add `@objectstack/metadata-fs` — Node-only `FileSystemRepository`
  implementation of the M0 Repository contract.

  Layout:

  ```
  <root>/
    <type>/<name>.json          # canonical body (atomic rename writes)
    .objectstack/.log/<branch>.jsonl   # append-only change log
  ```

  Features:

  - All 17 contract tests pass (`singleBranch: true`).
  - Per-key serialization via `KeyedMutex`.
  - Atomic writes via tmpfile + rename.
  - Heads and `seq` recovered from the JSONL log on `start()` — survives
    process restart.
  - chokidar watcher translates external edits (e.g. VSCode saves) into
    `MetadataEvent`s with `source: 'fs'`.
  - Self-write suppression: 200ms window prevents the watcher from
    re-emitting events for files we wrote ourselves.
  - Manual `AsyncIterator` for `watch()` to mirror the in-memory pattern.

  Also (`metadata-core`):

  - Add `singleBranch` option to `runRepositoryContractTests` so
    single-branch backends (like the FS one) skip the cross-branch test.
  - Switch tsup `splitting: true` so `index.js` and `testing.js` share a
    single `ConflictError` class identity (was double-bundled before).

  See ADR-0008 §10 PR-4.
