# @objectstack/skills

## 18.0.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 165587e: New published package `@objectstack/skills`: the ObjectStack skills catalog (`skills/**` of the repository), shipped in the changeset `fixed` group so it always carries the version of the `@objectstack/*` packages it teaches. Its build copies the catalog into `dist/skills/<skill>/…` byte for byte (the layout the skills CLI's `experimental_sync` reads from `node_modules`), and `files` lists only that tree. The repository's `skills/**` stays the one source of truth and the documented `next` channel; nothing a consumer writes changes.
  
  `@objectstack/spec`: `llms.txt`'s package-ecosystem count reads 69 with `@objectstack/skills` joining the scope.

### Patch Changes

- e4a770d: docs(skills): the `objectstack-ai` skill names the `agent` type's environment-overlay switch by its protocol-18 spelling, `allowEnvironmentOverlay:false` (#22340 S3)
  
  Clause-②: no
  
  `skills/objectstack-ai/SKILL.md`'s "Platform agents — reference only" section said the `agent` type is closed with `allowOrgOverride:false`. That key was renamed to `allowEnvironmentOverlay` in protocol 18 (ADR-0131 D6 retired the per-organization overlay axis, so the key names the one scope it governs; the old key stays on the registry entry schema only as a tombstone that refuses at parse with the new name in its prescription), so the published line now reads `allowEnvironmentOverlay:false`. The value, the `allowRuntimeCreate:false` beside it and the ADR-0063 §2 citation are unchanged; nothing an author writes changes. The same rename is recorded in `AGENTS.md` rule 7 and as header amendment notes on ADR-0005 and ADR-0010, none of which publishes.
- 179f7bf: fix(skills): the `objectstack-data` field-types rule names all five formula `returnType` members, `'currency'` included, and the `currencyConfig` a currency formula carries (#22743)
  
  Clause-②: no
  
  `skills/objectstack-data/rules/field-types.md` taught a formula's `returnType` as the four-member set `'number' | 'text' | 'boolean' | 'date'`, and its formula example said `(no 'currency')`. `@objectstack/spec`'s `FieldSchema.returnType` is the five-member enum `'number' | 'text' | 'boolean' | 'date' | 'currency'`, and a formula whose `returnType` is `'currency'` carries its currency in its own `currencyConfig` — `CurrencyConfigSchema`, the same shape a `currency` field declares; absent, the mode is `dynamic`, the tenant default currency. The `formula` table row and the formula example now both state the five-member set and name `currencyConfig` as the carrier. The example's `CEL — record. prefixes required` comment, which restated the table cell above it, is removed to pay the skill's token ratchet. Nothing is said about how a currency formula renders.
- eed637c: docs(automation): every text that teaches a sender of an inbound `api` hook teaches the timestamped `x-objectstack-signature` form only — `t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex>`, the HMAC-SHA256 of `<t>.<raw body>` under the flow's secret, refused when `t` is more than 300 seconds from the server clock
  
  Clause-②: no
  
  The inbound hook door has accepted the timestamped form since `signHttpBodyAt` landed in `@objectstack/core`, and it is the only form that stops a captured post from verifying forever; the published teaching still showed the body-only `sha256=<hex>` form. The guidance converges first; the door's refusal of the body-only form is a later change of its own.
  
  - **`@objectstack/skills`.** The `objectstack-automation` skill's Inbound webhook section teaches `t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex>`: `v1` is the HMAC-SHA256 of `<t>.<raw body>` under the start node's `secret`, and the door refuses a `t` more than 300 seconds from its clock. The body-only form is no longer shown.
  - **`@objectstack/lint`.** The hint of `flow-api-trigger-secret-missing` and its `os explain` entry describe the same form. The rule's id, severity, verdict sentence and judgement are unchanged.
  - The showcase example's comment and the platform checklist's intake recipe sign the same way.
  
  **Nothing to migrate for an author.** A sender that already signs with `signHttpBodyAt` is unchanged. **The outbound contract stays as published:** the messaging outbox and the flow `http` node keep signing body-only (`signHttpBody`) for third-party receivers, and the inbound door's accept set is not changed by this release.
- e9e10fd: docs(skills): the `objectstack-data` indexing rule's partial-index example teaches the rule with an application-shaped index instead of restating the platform's overlay uniqueness key (#23039)
  
  Clause-②: no
  
  `skills/objectstack-data/rules/indexing.md`'s "Access methods and partial indexes" section illustrated a partial index with the platform's own overlay-uniqueness DDL and said that was what `ensureOverlayIndex` runs. The quoted key had four parts; the platform's runtime key has carried a fifth, `bundle_member`, since protocol 18, so the sentence stated something the platform no longer runs. The example is re-cut to an application-shaped partial index — one *active* subscription per account, the coarse `{ fields: ['account_id'] }` declared in metadata and the unique partial form built in a migration — so the rule is taught without restating a platform key that changes on its own schedule. The rule itself is unchanged: declare the coarse index (or none) in metadata, build the partial form as raw SQL in a runtime migration, fall back to a plain index on a dialect that rejects the predicate. Nothing an author writes changes.
