### Minor Changes

- 44c5348: fix: two runtime gaps found by driving the CRM example end-to-end.

  **Delete of a parent with a required-FK child no longer fails with a misleading "<field> is required" error.** `cascadeDeleteRelations` defaulted a `lookup` FK to `set_null`; for a _required_ FK that issued an UPDATE clearing the column, which the child's validator rejected with a `400 "<field> is required"` naming a field that isn't even on the object being deleted (e.g. deleting a `crm_account` with opportunities → `"account is required"`). A required FK can't be nulled, so a _defaulted_ `set_null` now escalates to `restrict`: the delete is refused with a clear `409 DELETE_RESTRICTED` carrying the dependent object + count (`"Cannot delete crm_account (…): 4 dependent crm_opportunity record(s) reference it via account … set deleteBehavior:'cascade'"`). Explicit `cascade`/`restrict` and optional (nullable) lookups are unchanged.

  **Removed the hardcoded `POST /data/lead/:id/convert` endpoint + `convertLead` protocol method.** It hardcoded bare object names (`lead`/`account`/`contact`/`opportunity`) and a fixed Salesforce field mapping into the framework runtime, so it was unreachable by any real (namespaced) app — `/data/crm_lead/:id/convert` 404s, and the literal `lead` object doesn't exist. Lead conversion is an app concern modeled correctly as a flow (the CRM ships a `crm_convert_lead_wizard` screen flow); baking a CRM-specific workflow into the framework was false surface. Untested, undocumented, unused by the example. Removed.

### Minor Changes

- 7fe0b91: feat(rest): enforce object-level API exposure (`enable.apiEnabled` / `enable.apiMethods`) on the REST data surface (ADR-0049 #1889). Previously these flags were parsed but unenforced — an object could not be hidden from the automatic API, a false sense of security. Now: `apiEnabled: false` → the object's `/api/v1/data/{object}` routes return 404 (existence not revealed); a non-empty `apiMethods` whitelist → operations outside it return 405. Enforced across list/get/create/query/update/delete/import/export/batch/createMany/updateMany/deleteMany. Default-allow (objects with no `enable` block, or `apiEnabled` unset/true and no `apiMethods`) behave exactly as before — no regression. This is the _external_ API boundary only; internal callers (hooks, flows, objectql) are unaffected.
- 884bf2f: feat: record clone — wire the `object.enable.clone` capability to a real runtime (previously a parsed-but-dead flag).

  - **objectql**: new `protocol.cloneData({ object, id, overrides?, context? })` — reads the source record, drops engine-owned columns (`id` + audit `created_at`/`created_by`/`updated_at`/`updated_by`, plus `system`-flagged, `autonumber`, `formula` and `summary` fields) so the insert path re-derives them, applies caller `overrides` last, and inserts the copy. Shallow by design (duplicates the record's own fields, not its child records). Gated by `schema.enable.clone`: default-on, an explicit `enable.clone === false` throws `403 CLONE_DISABLED`.
  - **rest**: new `POST /api/v1/data/:object/:id/clone` (201 → `{ object, id, sourceId, record }`). Optional body `{ overrides }` (or a bare field map) overrides copied values, e.g. a new `name` or a cleared unique field. Honors the same auth + `enable.apiEnabled`/`apiMethods` gates as the rest of the data surface; `enable.clone === false` → 403.

  Reclassifies `object.enable.clone` `dead → live` in the spec liveness ledger.

### Minor Changes

- 71578f2: feat(book): documentation navigation as a `book` element — spine + derived membership (ADR-0046 §6)

  Adds the `book` metadata element: a navigation **spine** (ordered groups + `audience` + identity) whose membership is **derived** by rule (`include` glob/tag) plus optional per-doc `order`/`group`, never a central array. This keeps AI authoring create-and-forget (no central-array read-modify-write) and runtime overlay merge-safe (RFC 7396 treats arrays atomically).

  - `BookSchema` + `resolveBookTree()` derived-membership resolver + `defineBook()` + additive `doc.order`/`doc.group`.
  - Register `book` as a render-time metadata type (`allowOrgOverride: true`); wire it through the runtime type enumerations (PLURAL_TO_SINGULAR, engine registration, artifact field map, type-schema map).
  - REST `GET /meta/book/:name/tree` resolves the tree; read-layer `audience` gating (`public` ≡ anonymous; `org`/`{profile}` require sign-in).

## 9.5.0

### Minor Changes

- d08551c: feat(ADR-0046): per-locale documentation content (doc i18n)

  Docs can now ship localized bodies. Authors add sibling locale-variant files
  `src/docs/<name>.<locale>.md` (e.g. `crm_lead_guide.zh.md`, `..pt-BR.md`) next
  to the base `<name>.md`; the base stays the default and the fallback. Flatness is
  preserved — variants are flat siblings, not subdirectories.

  - **spec**: `DocSchema` gains an optional `translations` map
    (`locale → {label?, description?, content}`) plus `resolveDocLocale(doc, locale)`,
    which collapses a doc to the best-matching locale (exact → primary subtag
    `zh-CN`→`zh` → base) with per-field fallback and strips the `translations` map.
  - **cli (collect-docs)**: variant files are folded into the base doc's
    `translations`; orphan/duplicate variants and the v1 MDX/image bans are linted
    on variant content too.
  - **rest**: `/meta/doc` (list + single) resolves the request locale from the
    existing `Accept-Language` / `?locale` negotiation, returns one localized body,
    and never ships the `translations` map. Doc detail bypasses the response cache
    so a language switch can't return a stale-locale body.
  - **setup / studio**: the built-in overview docs now ship `zh` translations
    (TS-first inline `translations`), so a Chinese console renders Chinese docs.

  The console already sends the active UI language as `Accept-Language`, so doc
  content localizes on a language switch with no client change.

## 9.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0856476: feat(metadata): package-scoped single-item resolution via `?package=` (ADR-0048)

  A single-item metadata GET (`/meta/:type/:name?package=<id>`) now resolves
  package-scoped (prefer-local): when two installed packages ship an item of the
  same `type`/`name`, the requester's own package wins. Previously only the _list_
  endpoint was package-aware; a single-item fetch was context-free, so a
  cross-package collision always resolved to whichever package registered first.

  The fix threads `packageId` end-to-end:

  - `@objectstack/rest` — the cacheable single-item path called `getMetaItemCached`
    (ETag keyed on type+name only) and dropped `?package=`. A `?package=` read now
    bypasses that cache and takes the disambiguating `getMetaItem(type, name,
packageId)` path, so two same-named items never share one cache entry.
  - `@objectstack/objectql` — `protocol.getMetaItem` forwards `packageId` to the
    overlay query (`sys_metadata.package_id`), `MetadataFacade.get`, and
    `registry.getItem`; `MetadataFacade.get` gained an optional `currentPackageId`.
  - `@objectstack/runtime` — the parallel HTTP dispatcher threads `?package=` too.

  This lets the doc viewer (`/apps/:packageId/docs/:name`) resolve one doc scoped
  to its app, so `doc` names no longer need a namespace prefix for uniqueness (the
  prefix becomes a recommended convention, like `page`/`dashboard`/`report`);
  `doc.zod` doc-comments updated accordingly.

### Patch Changes

- 3e675f6: fix(metadata): package-scope the layered (Studio editor) read via `?package=` (ADR-0048)

  The `?layers=true` single-item read (the Studio metadata editor's 3-state
  code/overlay/effective view) ignored `packageId`, so editing one of two
  same-named items from different packages resolved ambiguously (first match).

  - `protocol.getMetaItemLayered` now threads `packageId` into the code layer
    (`metadataService.get` + `lookupArtifactItem` + `registry.getItem`) and the
    `sys_metadata` overlay query (`package_id` prefer-local).
  - `registry.getArtifactItem(type, name, currentPackageId?)` and
    `lookupArtifactItem` gained the optional package-scope hint.
  - `rest-server` threads `?package=` into the layered branch.

  This completes the per-route package-scoped resolution audit: the runtime
  render surface (dashboard/report/page/doc) was already scoped; this closes the
  Studio editor (`/apps/:appName/metadata/:type/:name`). Frontend counterpart
  sends `?package=` from the metadata list row's owning package.

## 9.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 290f631: ADR-0044 flow-level send-back-for-revision (#1744). The approval node gains a third flow movement beyond approve/reject: `sendBack()` finalizes the pending request as `returned` (new `ApprovalStatus`), resumes the run down its `revise` edge to a wait point where the record lock releases, and the submitter's `resubmit()` re-enters the approval node over a declared back-edge, opening the next round's request (fresh approver slate, re-locked, `round` stamped via the config snapshot). Engine: `FlowEdgeSchema.type` gains `'back'` — cycle validation now requires the graph _minus_ back-edges to be a DAG (unmarked cycles still rejected), node re-entry overwrites outputs/appends steps, a 100-re-entry runaway guard backstops misauthored loops, and `cancelRun(runId, reason)` lands as the first run-cancel primitive (recall crossing a revise window cancels the parked run). `maxRevisions` (default 3) on the approval node config auto-rejects send-backs past the budget. REST: `POST /approvals/requests/:id/revise` and `/resubmit`. Audit kinds `revise`/`resubmit` join `ApprovalActionKind` and the `sys_approval_action` enum.
- 50b7b47: Approvals server-side pagination + search pushdown (#1745). `listRequests` accepts `q` / `limit` / `offset` — free-text search pushes into the engine query as an `$or` of `$contains` terms (the `payload_json` snapshot carries record titles, so titles match without a join), and the page window pushes down whenever the filter is fully pushable; approver/status-array filters still post-filter their bounded scan and window in memory (the documented residual until the approver join-table follow-up). New `countRequests` returns the unwindowed total (engine `count` when pushable). REST: `GET /approvals/requests` gains `q`/`limit`/`offset` and returns `{data, total}` when paging.
- f8684ea: Approvals thread interactions — the collaboration layer between submit and decide. `reassign()` hands a pending-approver slot to someone else (audit-first ordering, new approver notified via the optional `messaging` service), `remind()` nudges every pending approver with a 4h per-request throttle (`THROTTLED` → HTTP 429), `requestInfo()` sends a request back to the submitter for more material while it stays pending, and `comment()` adds free-form thread replies. Rows expose `sla_due_at` (`created_at + escalation.timeoutHours`, display-only) and single reads attach `flow_steps` (the owning flow's approval trunk with done/current/upcoming states). REST grows the four matching POST routes; the `sys_approval_action.action` enum gains the new kinds.

### Patch Changes

- b08d08d: ADR-0046: `GET /meta/doc` list responses omit `content` by default (`?include=content` opts back in; `GET /meta/doc/:name` always returns the full body). The runtime dispatcher's `/metadata/doc` route already slims docs (#1789) — this applies the same rule on the REST `/meta/:type` route the console actually reads, keeping unbounded manuals off the list surface.

### Minor Changes

- 345e189: Robust multi-write transactions (ADR-0034). `engine.transaction()` now establishes an ambient transaction (AsyncLocalStorage) so every data operation during the callback — including internal reads performed while a write runs — binds to the active transaction's connection instead of asking the pool for another one and deadlocking on SQLite's single-connection pool. Adds a cross-object transactional batch endpoint (`POST /api/v1/data/batch`) with intra-batch `{ $ref: <opIndex> }` parent references, so a parent and its children can be created atomically in one transaction.

### Patch Changes

- 0a6438e: perf(rest): cache hostname→environment resolution; document cluster pub/sub durability (P1-4, P1-5)

  - **rest (P1-4):** `resolveByHostname()` ran on every unscoped request — a
    control-plane lookup (typically a DB query) in the hot path. `RestServer` now
    caches `hostname → environmentId` in-memory with a 30s TTL across all three
    resolution sites, caching negative results too so unknown hosts don't hammer the
    registry. Registry errors are not cached, so a transient blip self-heals.
  - **service-cluster-redis (P1-5):** recorded the durability contract for
    `metadata.changed` in `pubsub.ts`. Redis pub/sub is at-most-once **by design**;
    the event is a cache-invalidation hint only — the durable source of truth is the
    transactional `sys_metadata` (+ `sys_metadata_history`) write, so a missed event
    causes a stale cache until the next reload, never data loss. No code change to
    the delivery semantics; risk accepted and documented.

- ae7fb3f: fix(rest): advertise `routes.mcp` in /discovery when MCP is enabled (cloud#152)

  The objectui Integrations page reads `discovery.routes.mcp` to show the "Connect
  an AI agent" card, but it stayed absent on live envs even with MCP enabled. Root
  cause (NOT a cache, as first suspected): `@objectstack/rest` serves its OWN
  `/discovery` (`protocol.getDiscovery()`), separate from the dispatcher's
  `getDiscoveryInfo` where the `mcp` field was added — so the REST-served discovery
  never advertised it.

  The REST discovery handler now adds `routes.mcp` (pointing at the unscoped
  `/api/v1/mcp`, since the MCP route is mounted bare) when
  `OS_MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=true`, and omits it otherwise — mirroring the dispatcher
  discovery and the opt-in gate. 2 tests (enabled → advertised, disabled → absent).

- c262301: fix(rest): REST data API honors sys_api_key — one shared verifier with MCP (closes #1633)

  Staging e2e found the MCP surface authenticated a `sys_api_key` but the REST data
  API (`@objectstack/rest`) returned 401 for the same key — its `resolveExecCtx`
  only checked the better-auth session, never the API key.

  Converged both surfaces onto ONE verifier so they can't drift:

  - **`@objectstack/core/security`** now owns the shared `sys_api_key` primitives
    (`hashApiKey`, `generateApiKey`, `extractApiKey`, `parseScopes`, `isExpired`)
    plus a new `resolveApiKeyPrincipal(ql, headers, nowMs?)` that hashes the
    inbound key, looks it up by the indexed at-rest hash, and rejects unknown /
    revoked / expired / owner-less keys (fail-closed). `core` is the natural home:
    both `rest` and `runtime` depend on it, it depends on neither (no cycle), and
    it's server-side (already uses `node:crypto`).
  - **`@objectstack/runtime`** — `security/api-key.ts` re-exports the primitives
    from core (stable import surface) and `resolveExecutionContext` now delegates
    its API-key branch to `resolveApiKeyPrincipal`.
  - **`@objectstack/rest`** — `resolveExecCtx` resolves the data engine once and
    tries `resolveApiKeyPrincipal` (x-api-key / `Authorization: ApiKey`) BEFORE the
    session, so `/api/v1/data` + `/api/v1/meta` now authenticate an API key under
    the key's permissions + RLS, exactly like the dispatcher/MCP path.

  Tests: core `api-key.test.ts` (primitives + verifier: valid / revoked / expired /
  unknown / owner-less / plaintext-not-matched / fail-closed-ql). runtime + rest
  suites green.

- e1478fe: fix(rest): map schema-mismatch & not-null driver errors to structured 4xx

  `mapDataError` collapsed any SQL-looking driver error into a generic
  `500 DATABASE_ERROR`, so a bad write payload to the data API leaked a 500
  instead of a fixable 4xx (e.g. `POST /data/sys_team` with an unknown field,
  or omitting a required column). It now maps unknown-column errors to
  `400 INVALID_FIELD { field }` and not-null violations to
  `400 VALIDATION_FAILED { fields:[{required}] }` across SQLite/Postgres/MySQL
  phrasings, placed before the unknown-object branch so Postgres
  `column … of relation … does not exist` is not mis-mapped to 404. Genuine
  driver faults still return 500; unique violations still return 409.

### Patch Changes

- ac1fc4c: feat(metadata): optional storage teardown on delete so "publish to preview" leaves no orphan table

  Object storage was create-only: `publishMetaItem` creates a table (`ensureObjectStorage`) but nothing ever dropped one — `deleteMetaItem` only tombstones the metadata row, leaving the physical table behind. That made the pragmatic "publish an object just to preview it with real data, then discard if wrong" loop leave residue.

  Adds the inverse path, opt-in and guarded:

  - `engine.dropObjectSchema(name)` — inverse of `syncObjectSchema`; resolves the table name + driver and calls the driver's existing `dropTable` (DROP TABLE IF EXISTS / drop collection).
  - `deleteMetaItem({ …, dropStorage })` — when `true`, drops the object's physical table after the metadata is removed. **DESTRUCTIVE**, so it is gated: `object` type only (others have no table), `active` state only (drafts were never materialised), and never a `sys_`-prefixed platform table. Default `false` keeps delete non-destructive to data. Best-effort: a drop failure is logged, not thrown.
  - REST: `DELETE /meta/:type/:name?dropStorage=true` threads the flag.

  This makes "publish to preview → discard" cleanly reversible. Combined with the draft-overlay read mode, it backs the team's chosen approach: lean on publish (into a dev sandbox) for data-level confirmation rather than building a full draft-data preview, and make that publish safely undoable.

## 7.8.0

### Patch Changes

- a75823a: feat(metadata): expose pending DRAFT metadata (ADR-0033 draft discoverability)

  AI-authored metadata lands as drafts (`sys_metadata` rows with `state='draft'`, bound to an app package), but the only list path — `getMetaItems` — reads the active registry, so drafts were invisible: a just-built app package looked empty and there was no "pending changes" surface.

  - `SysMetadataRepository.listDrafts({type?, packageId?})` lists draft rows (mirrors `list()` but scoped to `state='draft'`, optionally narrowed by package), returning a light header projection (no body) with `packageId`.
  - `protocol.listDrafts({packageId?, type?, organizationId?})` exposes it over the overlay repo.
  - `GET /api/v1/meta/_drafts?packageId=&type=` surfaces it to the console. Registered in the REST server before the greedy `/meta/:type` route (and mirrored in the dispatcher) so `_drafts` is never captured as a metadata type name.

  Read-only; no behavior change to existing list/publish paths. Powers the upcoming Studio "drafts/pending changes" view and draft-aware package contents.

### Minor Changes

- 2faf9f2: External Datasource Federation (ADR-0015) — REST surface.

  Adds `registerExternalDatasourceRoutes`, mounting `/api/v1/datasources/:name/
external/*` — `GET tables`, `POST tables/:remote/draft`, `POST refresh-catalog`,
  `POST validate` — served by the `external-datasource` service and wired into the
  REST API plugin. Routes return `503 external_service_unavailable` when the
  service is not registered, so they are safe to mount unconditionally.

### Patch Changes

- 58b450b: Make metadata labels follow the active UI language without a page refresh (#1319).

  The client now carries the active locale on every request (`Accept-Language`,
  `setLocale`/`getLocale`), the protocol ETag is locale-aware so cached metadata
  no longer collides across languages, and the `client-react` metadata hooks
  refetch when the locale changes. The `apps/account` console wires its router
  locale through so a language switch relabels server-resolved object/field/view
  labels in place instead of leaving the UI half-translated until reload.

- 82eb6cf: Fix system-metadata translations: locale fallback, app/dashboard localization, and coverage gaps.

  Switching the UI language left many surfaces in English. Three root causes
  are addressed:

  - **Locale fallback (server).** The metadata translation resolver
    (`@objectstack/spec` `i18n-resolver`) now resolves a requested locale
    against the locales actually present in the bundle (exact →
    case-insensitive → base-language → variant), so a request for `zh`
    correctly hits the `zh-CN` bundle instead of falling back to English.
    This mirrors `resolveLocale` in `@objectstack/core` and benefits every
    resolver (objects, views, actions, settings, metadata forms).

  - **App & dashboard localization (server).** Added `translateApp` and
    `translateDashboard` resolvers and wired `app`/`dashboard` into the REST
    `/meta` translation path. App labels, sidebar/navigation group labels,
    and dashboard titles/widgets were previously never localized at the API
    boundary even though the translation data existed.

  - **Coverage & quality (data).** Added translations for the previously
    untranslated platform objects `sys_share_link`, `sys_view_definition`,
    and `sys_metadata_audit` (and registered them in the i18n-extract config
    so future extractions keep them). Replaced English placeholder strings
    left in the `zh-CN` / `ja-JP` / `es-ES` object and metadata-form bundles
    (notably action `confirmText` / `successMessage` prompts). Added the
    missing `es-ES` built-in Settings bundle in `@objectstack/service-settings`.

### Minor Changes

- c8b9f57: Metadata Admin engine — protocol foundations.

  This is the backend half of the unified Metadata Admin shipped in the Setup
  app. The framework now exposes everything the engine needs to render a
  directory tile, schema-driven form, layered diff, references graph, and
  destructive-change confirmation for every registered metadata type.

  - **`GET /api/v1/meta/types`** is now type-rich. Each entry includes
    `{ icon, domain, schema (JSONSchema), allowOrgOverride, allowRuntimeCreate, supportsOverlay, ui? }`
    so the client can render without a second round-trip per type.
  - **`GET /api/v1/meta/:type/:name/references`** scans every registered
    metadata type for pointers to the given item (object fields, view sources,
    flow targets, permission objects, …) and returns the inbound edges so the
    UI can warn before deletes.
  - **`GET /api/v1/meta/:type/:name?layers=code,overlay,effective`** returns
    each layer separately rather than the merged effective document, powering
    the 3-state diff editor (code source / overlay / effective).
  - **Destructive-change detection** on `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name` and
    `PUT /api/v1/meta/field/:name`: rejects field type narrowing, required
    toggled on without a default, removed enum values, etc., unless the
    client opts in with `force=true`.
  - **Env-var registry patch:** `OBJECTSTACK_METADATA_WRITABLE=object,field,permission,view,…`
    flips `allowOrgOverride` on for the listed types at boot, enabling
    runtime overlays for production without re-deploying spec.
  - New guide: **[Adding a Metadata Type](../content/docs/guides/adding-a-metadata-type.mdx)**
    walks through registry entry + Zod schema + optional custom editor.

  Setup app navigation now uses the new component-route variant
  (`{ type: 'component', componentRef: 'metadata:directory' }`) — the temporary
  `/dev/meta` route is removed.

### Major Changes

- 944f187: # v5.0 — `project` → `environment` hard rename

  The runtime concept previously called **"project"** (per-tenant business
  workspace; Org → **Project** → Branch hierarchy; per-project ObjectKernel,
  per-project DB, per-project artifact) is now uniformly called
  **"environment"**.

  This is a **hard rename with no aliases, deprecation shims, or compatibility
  layer**. Upgrade requires a coordinated update of CLI, runtime, server, and any
  clients calling the REST API.

  > Note: "project" in the npm / monorepo sense (the framework itself, `package.json`,
  > tsconfig project references, vitest `projects` config) is **unchanged**.

  ## Breaking changes

  ### CLI

  - Flags renamed:
    - `--project` / `-p` → `--environment` / `-e` (`os publish`, `os rollback`)
    - `--project-id` → `--environment-id` (`os dev`)
  - Default local env id: `proj_local` → `env_local`.
  - Env var: `OS_PROJECT_ID` → `OS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`.
  - Command group renamed: `os projects ...` → `os environments ...`
    (`bind`, `create`, `list`, `show`, `switch`).
  - Persisted auth-config key: `activeProjectId` → `activeEnvironmentId`.

  ### HTTP / REST

  - Scoped routes: `/api/v1/projects/:projectId/...` → `/api/v1/environments/:environmentId/...`.
  - Cloud control-plane routes: `/api/v1/cloud/projects/...` → `/api/v1/cloud/environments/...`
    (including `/cloud/environments/:id/artifact`, `/cloud/environments/:id/metadata`,
    `/cloud/environments/:id/credentials/rotate`, etc.).
  - Header: `X-Project-Id` (and lowercase `x-project-id`) → `X-Environment-Id`
    (`x-environment-id`).
  - Route param name in handlers: `req.params.projectId` → `req.params.environmentId`.
  - Hostname-routing and tenant-resolution code-paths use `environmentId` end-to-end.

  ### Runtime / spec

  - Exported symbols (no aliases):
    - `createSystemProjectPlugin` → `createSystemEnvironmentPlugin`
    - `SYSTEM_PROJECT_ID` → `SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
    - `ProjectArtifactSchema` → `EnvironmentArtifactSchema`
    - `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_SCHEMA_VERSION` → `ENVIRONMENT_ARTIFACT_SCHEMA_VERSION`
    - `ObjectOSProjectPlugin` → `ObjectOSEnvironmentPlugin`
    - `createSingleProjectPlugin` → `createSingleEnvironmentPlugin`
  - Plugin identifier strings:
    - `com.objectstack.runtime.objectos-project` → `objectos-environment`
    - `com.objectstack.studio.single-project` → `single-environment`
    - `com.objectstack.multi-project` → `multi-environment`
    - `com.objectstack.runtime.system-project` → `system-environment`
  - Provisioning hook: `provisionSystemProject` → `provisionSystemEnvironment`.

  ### Database / schemas

  - Column renames on `sys_metadata` and `sys_metadata_history`:
    `project_id` → `environment_id`.
  - Column renames on `sys_activity`: `project_id` → `environment_id` (plus index).
  - Object renames in platform-objects metadata: `sys_project` → `sys_environment`
    (lookup targets), `sys_project_member` → `sys_environment_member`,
    `sys_project_credential` → `sys_environment_credential`.
  - Auth-context field: `active_project_id` → `active_environment_id`.
  - JSON schemas under `packages/spec/json-schema/system/`:
    `ProjectArtifact*.json` → `EnvironmentArtifact*.json` (regenerated at build).

  ### Automatic forward migration

  A new migration `migrateProjectIdToEnvironmentId`
  (`packages/metadata/src/migrations/migrate-project-id-to-environment-id.ts`)
  auto-runs from `DatabaseLoader.ensureSchema()` on bootstrap and rewrites any
  existing `project_id` column on `sys_metadata` / `sys_metadata_history` to
  `environment_id` (idempotent, best-effort). Existing rows are preserved.

  The legacy reverse migration `migrateEnvIdToProjectId` is retained verbatim
  for historical / disaster-recovery use; it is **not** auto-run.

  ## Migration guide

  ```diff
  -os publish --project proj_xyz
  +os publish --environment env_xyz

  -curl -H "X-Project-Id: env_xyz" https://api.example.com/api/v1/data/customer
  +curl -H "X-Environment-Id: env_xyz" https://api.example.com/api/v1/data/customer

  -OS_PROJECT_ID=env_xyz os dev
  +OS_ENVIRONMENT_ID=env_xyz os dev

  -import { createSystemProjectPlugin, SYSTEM_PROJECT_ID } from "@objectstack/runtime";
  +import { createSystemEnvironmentPlugin, SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_ID } from "@objectstack/runtime";

  -import { ProjectArtifactSchema } from "@objectstack/spec";
  +import { EnvironmentArtifactSchema } from "@objectstack/spec";
  ```

  If you maintain a Cloud control-plane deployment, the `cloud` repository must
  be updated in lockstep to pick up the new plugin identifier strings
  (`single-environment`, `multi-environment`, `objectos-environment`).

## 5.2.0

### Patch Changes

- b806f58: Scope `sys_user` visibility to fellow organization members.

  The default RLS policy on `sys_user` was `id = current_user.id`, which meant
  @-mention pickers, owner/assignee lookups, reviewer selectors and the user
  roster all returned just the current user. The RLS compiler doesn't support
  subqueries, so a `id IN (SELECT user_id FROM sys_member ...)` policy isn't
  expressible.

  This change:

  1. Pre-resolves `org_user_ids` (the IDs of all users in the active org) into
     `ExecutionContext` in **all three** REST entry-point resolvers
     (`@objectstack/rest`, `@objectstack/runtime`, `@objectstack/plugin-hono-server`).
  2. Adds the field to `ExecutionContextSchema` so it survives Zod parsing.
  3. Adds an `org_user_ids` field to the RLS compiler's user context.
  4. Adds a new `sys_user_org_members` policy (`id IN (current_user.org_user_ids)`)
     to both `member_default` and `viewer_readonly` permission sets, alongside
     the existing `sys_user_self` policy. The RLS compiler OR-combines them, so
     users see themselves AND their org collaborators.

  Capped at 1000 members per request. Large enterprises should plug in a
  directory cache or split per workspace.

### Minor Changes

- 5cfdc85: PR-10d.4 — REST plumbing for the metadata repository write path.

  - `PUT /api/v1/meta/:type/:name` (and the compound `:type/:section/:name` variant)
    now forwards the `If-Match` header to `saveMetaItem` as `parentVersion`, and
    `X-Actor` (or `req.user.id`) as `actor`. ETag-style quotes are stripped.
  - A failed optimistic-lock check surfaces as HTTP 409 with body
    `{ "error": "...", "code": "metadata_conflict" }` (no protocol changes —
    `sendError` already honoured `error.status` + `error.code`).
  - Added a real-engine integration test for the repository write path
    (`protocol-save-meta-repo-path-real-engine.test.ts`) — addresses the
    PR-10d.3 rubber-duck stub-drift concern by exercising
    `ObjectStackProtocolImplementation.saveMetaItem` through `new ObjectQL()`
    with an inline in-memory driver. Covers insert→update version bump,
    parentVersion conflict, checksum length, and plural→singular normalization.

  Default behaviour unchanged: the repository write path remains opt-in via
  `options.useRepositoryWritePath` / `OBJECTSTACK_USE_REPOSITORY_WRITE_PATH=1`.
  Flag flip and legacy path removal will follow in a separate post-soak PR.

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2869891: feat: Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) via `If-Match`

  Update and Delete requests now accept an optional version token. When supplied,
  the protocol compares it against the record's current `updated_at` (or `version`
  column when available) and rejects with `409 CONCURRENT_UPDATE` on mismatch,
  preventing silent overwrites when two clients edit the same record.

  **Wire formats** (opt-in, all server- and client-backward-compatible):

  - `PATCH /data/{object}/{id}` — supports `If-Match: "<token>"` header
    _or_ `expectedVersion: "<token>"` body field (body wins when both present).
  - `DELETE /data/{object}/{id}` — supports `If-Match` header _or_
    `?expectedVersion=...` query param.
  - Conflict response: `409 { error, code: 'CONCURRENT_UPDATE', currentVersion,
currentRecord }` so the client can offer Reload / Overwrite / Cancel UX.

  **Behaviour**

  - Missing/empty version → no check (legacy callers unaffected).
  - Record not found during the version probe → no check; the downstream write
    produces a normal `404`.
  - Object has no `updated_at` column → no check (explicit opt-out for objects
    without timestamps).
  - Quoted RFC-7232 tokens (`"…"`) are accepted and unquoted before comparison.

  **Client**

  `client.data.update(resource, id, data, { ifMatch })` and
  `client.data.delete(resource, id, { ifMatch })` now forward the token as an
  `If-Match` header.

  Application-level CAS (findOne + compare in protocol.ts) is used in this slice
  to avoid touching every storage driver. A small TOCTOU window remains; for the
  B2B record-editing latencies this protects against, it is more than sufficient.
  Drivers may later be upgraded to atomic `WHERE id=? AND updated_at=?` writes
  for true CAS without changing the public API.

  Tests: 7 new cases in `protocol-data.test.ts` cover opt-in, match, mismatch,
  quote-stripping, no-timestamps, empty-token, and the delete path.

  - **@objectstack/cli**: Removed Vite dev server fallback — always serves pre-built dist, no extra port
  - **@objectstack/studio**: Interactive API Console in Object Explorer (request builder, response viewer, history)
  - **@objectstack/spec**: Studio Plugin schema, MCP Protocol schemas, API versioning, Dispatcher protocol
  - **@objectstack/spec**: Comprehensive `.describe()` annotations across all Zod schemas
  - **@objectstack/core**: Production hot reload and dynamic plugin loading protocol

  // Before (1.1.0) — implicit
  const runtime = new Runtime({ api: { basePath: "/api/v1" } });

  // After (1.2.0) — explicit
  import { createRestApiPlugin } from "@objectstack/rest";
  const runtime = new Runtime();
  runtime.use(createRestApiPlugin({ basePath: "/api/v1" }));
  ```

  ### z.any() → z.unknown() (~30 fields)

  Fields like `metadata`, `defaultValue`, `filters`, `config`, `data` now use `z.unknown()`. Add type narrowing where needed.

  ### Hub schemas relocated

  Barrel imports via `Hub.*` still work. Direct path imports (`hub/license.zod.ts` → `system/license.zod.ts`) need updating.

  ### MetricType renamed

  `MetricType` (analytics) → `AggregationMetricType`, `MetricType` (licensing) → `LicenseMetricType`

  ### Deprecations

  - `HttpDispatcher` → `createDispatcherPlugin()`
  - `createHonoApp` → `HonoServerPlugin`

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @objectstack/spec@2.0.0
  - @objectstack/core@2.0.0

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ## New Features

  - **@objectstack/rest** (new package): Extracted REST server, route management, and `createRestApiPlugin` into a dedicated package
  - **@objectstack/runtime**: Add `createDispatcherPlugin` for structured route management (auth, graphql, analytics, packages, hub, storage, automation)
  - **@objectstack/cli**: Dev mode (`--dev`) now auto-enables Studio UI at `/_studio/` — no need for `--ui` flag; use `--no-ui` to disable
  - **@objectstack/cli**: Root URL `/` redirects to `/_studio/` in dev mode for convenience
  - **@objectstack/cli**: Removed Vite dev server fallback — always serves pre-built dist, no extra port
  - **@objectstack/studio**: Interactive API Console in Object Explorer (request builder, response viewer, history)
  - **@objectstack/spec**: Studio Plugin schema (`Studio.PluginManifest`)
  - **@objectstack/spec**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) schemas for AI tools, resources, prompts, transport
  - **@objectstack/spec**: API versioning schema with multiple strategies
  - **@objectstack/spec**: Dispatcher protocol schema
  - **@objectstack/spec**: Comprehensive `.describe()` annotations across all Zod schemas for JSON Schema generation
  - **@objectstack/core**: Production hot reload and dynamic plugin loading protocol

  ## Migration Guide (from 1.1.0)

  ### RuntimeConfig.api removed

  REST API is now opt-in. If you relied on automatic REST registration:

  ```ts
  // Before (1.1.0) — implicit
  const runtime = new Runtime({ api: { basePath: "/api/v1" } });

  // After (1.2.0) — explicit
  import { createRestApiPlugin } from "@objectstack/rest";
  const runtime = new Runtime();
  runtime.use(createRestApiPlugin({ basePath: "/api/v1" }));
  ```

  ### z.any() → z.unknown() (~30 fields)

  Fields like `metadata`, `defaultValue`, `filters`, `config`, `data` in spec schemas changed from `z.any()` to `z.unknown()`. If you consume inferred types, add type narrowing:

  ```ts
  // Before — worked silently
  const val: string = record.metadata.foo;

  // After — requires narrowing
  const meta = record.metadata as Record<string, string>;
  const val = meta.foo;
  ```

  ### Hub schemas relocated

  - `hub/composer.zod.ts`, `hub/marketplace.zod.ts`, `hub/space.zod.ts`, `hub/hub-federation.zod.ts` — removed
  - `hub/plugin-registry.zod.ts` → `kernel/plugin-registry.zod.ts`
  - `hub/license.zod.ts` → `system/license.zod.ts`
  - `hub/tenant.zod.ts` → `system/tenant.zod.ts`

  Barrel imports via `Hub.*` namespace still work. Direct path imports need updating.

  ### MetricType renamed

  - `MetricType` (data analytics) → `AggregationMetricType`
  - `MetricType` (hub licensing) → `LicenseMetricType`

  ### Deprecations

  - `HttpDispatcher` → use `createDispatcherPlugin()` instead
  - `createHonoApp` → use `HonoServerPlugin` instead

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @objectstack/spec@2.0.0
  - @objectstack/core@2.0.0
