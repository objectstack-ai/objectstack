## 12.2.0

### Patch Changes

- 75c310f: Rewrite the `writable_package_required` rejection message as user-facing remediation ("switch to a writable package in the package selector, or create a new one") instead of developer-facing copy that cited an internal ADR path — the message is surfaced verbatim as a Studio toast. The ADR pointer moves to a `docs` property on the error; `code`, `status`, and `packageId` are unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 9796e7c: feat(security): two-doors separation for permission sets (ADR-0086 P2)

  Splits who may change a permission set into two non-overlapping doors, enforced
  at the data layer instead of by convention:

  **块 1 — the package door (publish-time materialization).**
  `ObjectStackProtocolImplementation` gains a generic publish-time materializer
  registry (`registerPublishMaterializer(type, fn)`). When a draft of a registered
  type is published, its body is projected into a data-plane row and the result is
  surfaced on the publish response as `materializeApplied` (best-effort, never
  thrown — same contract as `seedApplied`). `promoteDraft` now returns the draft's
  `packageId` so the materializer can stamp the owning package. `plugin-security`
  registers a `permission` materializer that upserts the published set into
  `sys_permission_set` with `managed_by:'package'` + `package_id` — so a set
  authored through the studio package door (saved as a `permission` draft, then
  published) lands in the admin surface with the exact provenance the boot seeder
  already stamps, now on the runtime publish path too. The single-set upsert is
  shared with `bootstrapDeclaredPermissions` (`upsertPackagePermissionSet`), so
  both paths apply the same own-row / foreign-package / env-authored rules.

  **块 2 — the admin door (data-layer write gate).**
  The security middleware now refuses any admin-door write
  (`update`/`delete`/`transfer`/`restore`/`purge`) to a `sys_permission_set` row
  with `managed_by:'package'`, and refuses an `insert` that forges
  `managed_by:'package'`. The gate fails closed regardless of the caller's grants
  (a platform admin with `modifyAllRecords` is blocked just the same), so it is a
  real data-layer boundary rather than a UI hint. System/boot writes carry
  `isSystem` and bypass the whole middleware, so the boot seeder and the publish
  materializer are unaffected. Env-authored sets (`managed_by` `user`/`platform`
  or absent) stay freely editable through the admin door — the two doors never
  overwrite each other.

### Patch Changes

- b5be479: fix(protocol): versionless package installs now persist to sys_packages (#2532)

  `installPackage` writes both package stores, but its durable half was guarded by
  `pkgSvc?.publish && manifest.version` — silently skipping every versionless
  runtime-created base (`{id, name}` from the builder / Setup). Those packages
  lived only in the in-memory registry and vanished on restart, while their
  metadata and tables survived. The version is now defaulted (`0.1.0`) instead of
  skipping, a failed persist logs loudly instead of silently, and `deletePackage`
  drops the `sys_packages` record so an uninstalled package no longer resurrects
  at the next boot (service-package hydrates that table into the registry).

- 2d567cb: Runtime-authored (Studio) hooks now execute their `body` (#2588).

  Previously a hook authored at runtime (saved via `protocol.saveMetaItem` /
  `publish-drafts`) loaded into the registry but its L1/L2 `body` never ran — the
  metadata-service bind path passed no `bodyRunner` and the engine's
  `_defaultBodyRunner` fallback was never installed, so the binder silently
  skipped the body. Now:

  - `AppPlugin` installs the QuickJS-sandboxed hook body runner as the engine
    default at boot (`engine.setDefaultBodyRunner`), so bind paths without an
    explicit runner can execute bodies. Opt out with
    `OS_DISABLE_AUTHORED_HOOKS=1` to keep runtime-authored hook bodies inert.
  - `ObjectQLPlugin` re-binds runtime-authored hooks from their `sys_metadata`
    rows at `kernel:ready` (cold boot — env-scoped kernels never surfaced these
    rows before), on `metadata:reloaded`, and on every hook mutation through the
    new `protocol.onMetadataMutation` listener — so saves, publishes, edits, and
    deletes take effect live, without a restart. Package-artifact hooks are
    excluded from this bind path (AppPlugin already binds them with an explicit
    runner) so they no longer risk double execution.
  - `@objectstack/metadata-protocol` gains a server-side
    `onMetadataMutation(listener)` API: `saveMetaItem` / `publishMetaItem` /
    `deleteMetaItem` notify subscribers after persistence succeeds.

- e3498fb: fix(runtime): carry spec-validation issues (and the 422 status) through metadata save/publish errors

  `protocol.saveMetaItem` already validates a metadata draft against its spec Zod
  schema and, on failure, throws a rich error: HTTP `status: 422`, `code:
'invalid_metadata'`, and a structured `issues: [{ path, message, code }]` array
  (field-anchored, `superRefine` issues included). But the HTTP dispatcher's catch
  blocks collapsed all of that to a single message — the save path even hardcoded
  `400` — so a client could only show a generic "failed validation" banner with no
  way to point at the offending field. The publish path was worse: the per-draft
  catch in `publishPackageDrafts` flattened each failure into `{ type, name, error
}` and **dropped `issues` entirely**.

  Now:

  - A new `errorFromThrown(e, fallbackStatus)` dispatcher helper preserves the
    error's own `status` (so validation surfaces as **422**, not a downgraded 400)
    and attaches `{ code, issues }` under `error.details` when present. Errors that
    carry neither behave exactly as before. Used by the metadata **save** (`PUT
/meta/:type/:name`) and **publish** (`POST /packages/:id/publish-drafts`)
    catch sites.
  - `publishPackageDrafts` now carries `issues` into each `failed[]` entry, so a
    validation failure during publish is field-anchored too (it previously kept
    only the message).

  This is the server half of "surface validation at the save/publish moment, on
  the field" — the Studio can now map each issue back to its input instead of
  showing a wall-of-text banner. Purely additive to the error payload; the only
  behavior change is the more-correct 422 (was 400) for a failed metadata save.

- 806a40a: Stop runtime view personalization from permanently removing views from the switcher.

  A console personalization PUT (grid column sort, inline edit, …) sends only the raw
  view config — no top-level `viewKind`/`object`. Persisted verbatim, the overlay row
  replaced the flattened package entry wholesale on read, stripping the identity fields
  every switcher-style consumer filters on (`viewKind && object`) — one sort click and
  the view vanished until the DB row was deleted (#2555).

  Two independent guards: `saveMetaItem` now inherits the missing `viewKind`/`object`/
  `label` from the registry entry the overlay shadows before persisting, and
  `getMetaItems` heals identity-less rows already in the DB the same way on read. The
  overlay's own fields always win; `defineView` container bodies are untouched.

### Minor Changes

- 13dbcf2: Extract metadata management into `@objectstack/metadata-protocol` (ADR-0076)

  `protocol.ts` (the `ObjectStackProtocol` implementation — sys_metadata CRUD, draft/publish, locks, package ownership, diagnostics) plus its `sys-metadata-repository`, `metadata-diagnostics`, `seed-loader`, and `build-probes` helpers were metadata-domain code that lived inside `@objectstack/objectql` for historical reasons. They now live in a dedicated **`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`** package.

  The protocol no longer depends on the concrete `ObjectQL` class — it is typed against an injected `MetadataHostEngine` interface (the engine is still injected at runtime). Dependency direction is now one-way (`objectql → metadata-protocol`); there is no cycle.

  **Non-breaking**: `@objectstack/objectql` re-exports every previously public symbol (`ObjectStackProtocolImplementation`, `SysMetadataRepository`, `SysMetadataEngine`, `SeedLoaderService`, `runBuildProbes`, …), so existing imports keep working.

  This is Step 1 of ADR-0076. A later step turns the protocol into a capability plugin so `objectql` itself stops depending on it (making the engine lean by construction).

  Also adds a lean **`@objectstack/objectql/core`** entry — the engine/registry/hooks/validation surface only, with no kernel plugin or metadata protocol — so a thin embedder can import just the engine and never pull `@objectstack/metadata-protocol` into its bundle. A boundary ratchet test guards the entry.
