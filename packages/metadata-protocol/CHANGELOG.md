### Minor Changes

- 1056c5f: Package uninstall now revokes the package's data-plane permission rows (#2747, ADR-0086 D3 / ADR-0090 D5 "no ghost grants").

  **`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`**: `deletePackage` gains an
  uninstall-cleanup seam — the exact mirror of the publish materializer:
  domain plugins register named cleanups via `registerUninstallCleanup(name,
fn)` and every cleanup runs with the uninstalled package id, its outcome
  reported on the new `cleanups` array of the response (a failed revocation is
  visible, never silent). `deletePackage` also unregisters the package from
  the in-memory SchemaRegistry (best-effort), so the running kernel stops
  serving it without waiting for a restart.

  **`@objectstack/plugin-security`**: registers the
  `security.package-permissions` cleanup — deletes the package's own
  `sys_permission_set` rows (`managed_by: 'package'` + matching `package_id`
  only; env-authored and foreign-package rows are never touched, ADR-0086 D4),
  their `sys_position_permission_set` / `sys_user_permission_set` bindings
  (bindings first, so no dangling grants), and the package's
  `sys_audience_binding_suggestion` rows (a reinstall re-prompts fresh).
  Also fixes the engine-call signature in the suggestion module: `find`/`delete`
  read `context` from their second argument — the previous trailing
  `{ context }` argument was ignored, so deletes ran principal-less.

  **`@objectstack/rest`**: `DELETE /api/v1/packages/:id` (no version pin) now
  goes through `protocol.deletePackage` — one uninstall semantic instead of a
  bare `sys_packages` row delete — removing the package's metadata, durable
  record, registry entry, and running the cleanups; the response carries
  `deletedCount` + `cleanups`. A version-scoped delete keeps the narrow
  durable-registry semantics.

## 13.0.0

### Minor Changes

- fc7e7f7: Enforce the package namespace-prefix rule for Studio-authored packages.

  The protocol requires every object name in a package to carry the package's
  `manifest.namespace` prefix (`crm_account`); `defineStack()` enforces this at
  compile time via `validateNamespacePrefix`. Studio/runtime-authored packages
  never take that path, and they were created without a namespace at all — so the
  rule was silently inert and objects published with bare, collision-prone names.

  Two runtime changes close the gap:

  - `protocol.installPackage` now derives a default namespace from the package id
    (`com.example.leave` → `leave`) when the manifest declares none, and persists
    it on the manifest (in-memory registry + `sys_packages`). An explicitly
    declared namespace always wins (e.g. HotCRM's `crm`).
  - `protocol.publishPackageDrafts` now rejects any object draft whose name lacks
    the package namespace prefix, before promoting anything (atomic), with an
    actionable message (`Rename it to 'leave_ticket'`). Packages that declare no
    namespace are grandfathered — mirroring `defineStack`, the rule is not
    invented at enforcement time.

  The per-object prefix check and the id→namespace derivation are extracted into
  `@objectstack/spec/kernel` (`validateObjectNamespacePrefix`,
  `deriveNamespaceFromPackageId`) as the single source shared by `defineStack` and
  the runtime publish path, so the two enforcement points cannot drift.

## 12.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 21420d9: Seed loader and data-import now route bulk writes through the engine's array-form `insert()` (one round-trip per batch, with parent-deduplicated summary recompute) instead of one `insert()`/`createData()` call per record, and both retry transient driver errors instead of silently dropping the row (#2678).

  A new shared helper, `bulkWrite` (`@objectstack/core`), batches rows through a caller-supplied batch-write function, retries a whole-batch transient failure (network blip / timeout) with exponential backoff, and degrades to per-row writes (each itself retried) when a batch fails for a non-transient reason — so one bad row can't drop the other N-1. `withTransientRetry` wraps a single write (e.g. an update) with the same retry behavior.

  - `SeedLoaderService.loadDataset()` (`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`) buffers insert-mode records and flushes them in batches of 200 via the engine's array `insert()`. Datasets with a self-referencing field (e.g. `employee.manager_id -> employee`) keep the historical per-record write path, since a later record may need an earlier one's freshly-assigned id.
  - `runImport()` (`@objectstack/rest`) buffers create-resolved rows and flushes them via `protocol.createManyData()` when the protocol supports it, falling back to the original per-row `createData()` call otherwise. `Protocol.createManyData` (`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`) now forwards `context` to `engine.insert()` like `createData` already did, so tenant-scoped bulk creates work correctly.

  Previously, a 1000-row seed or import into an object with a rollup summary issued 1000+ round-trips and up to 1000 summary recomputes; a single transient network error on any one row silently dropped it with no retry (the 2026-07-06 HotCRM first-boot incident). A `bulkCreate`-capable driver now sees roughly `ceil(N/batch)` writes, and a transient error is retried before a row is ever reported as failed.

  **Fix (`@objectstack/driver-sql`):** `SqlDriver.bulkCreate()` never generated a client-side id for a row missing one, unlike `create()` — a latent gap that this change is the first to exercise at scale (a bulk-inserted row without a driver-native id default silently landed with `id: NULL`). `bulkCreate()` now mirrors `create()`'s id/`_id` normalization per row.

## 12.5.0

### Patch Changes

- 8b3d363: Package metadata seed can no longer wedge the platform via record-change automation.

  A seeded record whose lifecycle flow self-triggered (a `record-after-update` flow
  writing back to its own trigger record) looped forever when its boolean re-entry
  guard never tripped — booleans persist as integer `1` on SQLite/libsql and CEL
  `1 != true` is `true`. During first-boot seed (which awaits automation) this hung
  the whole kernel build.

  Three layers:

  - `ExecutionContext.skipTriggers` (set by the seed-loader, threaded onto
    `HookContext.session` via `buildSession`) makes the record-change trigger skip
    flow dispatch for seed/bulk writes — seed data is end-state reference data, not
    user events. Lifecycle hooks still run.
  - `coerceBooleanFields()` converts SQLite 0/1 (and `'0'/'1'/'true'/'false'`) to
    real booleans on the after-hook view of a record (`hookContext.result` /
    `.previous`), so flow conditions see JS booleans. The value returned to the
    caller is unchanged.
  - The automation engine breaks a flow re-entering for the same record while an
    execution is still on the stack (`activeRecordFlows`), a backstop for any
    self-trigger loop.

## 12.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 60dc3ba: ADR-0087 P0 — enforce the protocol version handshake (make `engines.protocol` real).

  `PluginEnginesSchema.protocol` (ADR-0025 §3.2, protocol-first per §3.10 #3) was declared, documented, and checked by no loader or installer — an ADR-0078 "declarable-but-inert" violation. A package built against an incompatible protocol major failed deep in a schema `.parse()` or a renderer contract instead of at the boundary.

  - **`@objectstack/spec`**: exports `PROTOCOL_VERSION` / `PROTOCOL_MAJOR` (`kernel`) — the single source of truth the handshake checks against. A drift test keeps it in lockstep with the package major.
  - **`@objectstack/metadata-core`**: adds `checkProtocolCompat()` (pure, major-grained range check), `assertProtocolCompat()`, and the structured `ProtocolIncompatibleError` (`OS_PROTOCOL_INCOMPATIBLE`, carrying both versions and the `objectstack migrate meta --from N` command). It refuses only on a _positive_ mismatch determination; absent ranges are grandfathered (warn) and unrecognized ranges never cause a false rejection.
  - **`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`**: `installPackage` runs the handshake before writing to the registry — an incompatible package is refused with a machine-actionable diagnostic instead of crashing later.

  Additive and backward compatible: packages that declare no `engines.protocol` range keep loading (with a warning). Part of the ADR-0087 epic (#2643); resolves #2644.

- 1dd5dfd: feat(packages): edit a package manifest via `PATCH /packages/:id`

  Adds an editable path for a package's `name` / `description` / `version` after
  creation: `SchemaRegistry.updatePackageManifest` (merges in-memory, preserving
  lifecycle state), `protocol.updatePackage` (re-persists to `sys_packages`), and
  the `PATCH /packages/:id` route in the HTTP dispatcher. `id` / `scope` / `type`
  remain immutable.

The ADR pointer moves to a `docs` property on the error; `code`, `status`, and `packageId` are unchanged.

## 12.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 9796e7c: feat(security): two-doors separation for permission sets (ADR-0086 P2)

  Splits who may change a permission set into two non-overlapping doors, enforced
  at the data layer instead of by convention:

  **块 1 — the package door (publish-time materialization).**
  `ObjectStackProtocolImplementation` gains a generic publish-time materializer
  registry (`registerPublishMaterializer(type, fn)`). When a draft of a registered
  type is published, its body is projected into a data-plane row and the result is
  surfaced on the publish response as `materializeApplied` (best-effort, never
  thrown — same contract as `seedApplied`). `promoteDraft` now returns the draft's
  `packageId` so the materializer can stamp the owning package. `plugin-security`
  registers a `permission` materializer that upserts the published set into
  `sys_permission_set` with `managed_by:'package'` + `package_id` — so a set
  authored through the studio package door (saved as a `permission` draft, then
  published) lands in the admin surface with the exact provenance the boot seeder
  already stamps, now on the runtime publish path too. The single-set upsert is
  shared with `bootstrapDeclaredPermissions` (`upsertPackagePermissionSet`), so
  both paths apply the same own-row / foreign-package / env-authored rules.

  **块 2 — the admin door (data-layer write gate).**
  The security middleware now refuses any admin-door write
  (`update`/`delete`/`transfer`/`restore`/`purge`) to a `sys_permission_set` row
  with `managed_by:'package'`, and refuses an `insert` that forges
  `managed_by:'package'`. The gate fails closed regardless of the caller's grants
  (a platform admin with `modifyAllRecords` is blocked just the same), so it is a
  real data-layer boundary rather than a UI hint. System/boot writes carry
  `isSystem` and bypass the whole middleware, so the boot seeder and the publish
  materializer are unaffected. Env-authored sets (`managed_by` `user`/`platform`
  or absent) stay freely editable through the admin door — the two doors never
  overwrite each other.

### Patch Changes

- b5be479: fix(protocol): versionless package installs now persist to sys_packages (#2532)

  `installPackage` writes both package stores, but its durable half was guarded by
  `pkgSvc?.publish && manifest.version` — silently skipping every versionless
  runtime-created base (`{id, name}` from the builder / Setup). Those packages
  lived only in the in-memory registry and vanished on restart, while their
  metadata and tables survived. The version is now defaulted (`0.1.0`) instead of
  skipping, a failed persist logs loudly instead of silently, and `deletePackage`
  drops the `sys_packages` record so an uninstalled package no longer resurrects
  at the next boot (service-package hydrates that table into the registry).

- 2d567cb: Runtime-authored (Studio) hooks now execute their `body` (#2588).

  Previously a hook authored at runtime (saved via `protocol.saveMetaItem` /
  `publish-drafts`) loaded into the registry but its L1/L2 `body` never ran — the
  metadata-service bind path passed no `bodyRunner` and the engine's
  `_defaultBodyRunner` fallback was never installed, so the binder silently
  skipped the body. Now:

  - `AppPlugin` installs the QuickJS-sandboxed hook body runner as the engine
    default at boot (`engine.setDefaultBodyRunner`), so bind paths without an
    explicit runner can execute bodies. Opt out with
    `OS_DISABLE_AUTHORED_HOOKS=1` to keep runtime-authored hook bodies inert.
  - `ObjectQLPlugin` re-binds runtime-authored hooks from their `sys_metadata`
    rows at `kernel:ready` (cold boot — env-scoped kernels never surfaced these
    rows before), on `metadata:reloaded`, and on every hook mutation through the
    new `protocol.onMetadataMutation` listener — so saves, publishes, edits, and
    deletes take effect live, without a restart. Package-artifact hooks are
    excluded from this bind path (AppPlugin already binds them with an explicit
    runner) so they no longer risk double execution.
  - `@objectstack/metadata-protocol` gains a server-side
    `onMetadataMutation(listener)` API: `saveMetaItem` / `publishMetaItem` /
    `deleteMetaItem` notify subscribers after persistence succeeds.

- e3498fb: fix(runtime): carry spec-validation issues (and the 422 status) through metadata save/publish errors

  `protocol.saveMetaItem` already validates a metadata draft against its spec Zod
  schema and, on failure, throws a rich error: HTTP `status: 422`, `code:
'invalid_metadata'`, and a structured `issues: [{ path, message, code }]` array
  (field-anchored, `superRefine` issues included). But the HTTP dispatcher's catch
  blocks collapsed all of that to a single message — the save path even hardcoded
  `400` — so a client could only show a generic "failed validation" banner with no
  way to point at the offending field. The publish path was worse: the per-draft
  catch in `publishPackageDrafts` flattened each failure into `{ type, name, error
}` and **dropped `issues` entirely**.

  Now:

  - A new `errorFromThrown(e, fallbackStatus)` dispatcher helper preserves the
    error's own `status` (so validation surfaces as **422**, not a downgraded 400)
    and attaches `{ code, issues }` under `error.details` when present. Errors that
    carry neither behave exactly as before. Used by the metadata **save** (`PUT
/meta/:type/:name`) and **publish** (`POST /packages/:id/publish-drafts`)
    catch sites.
  - `publishPackageDrafts` now carries `issues` into each `failed[]` entry, so a
    validation failure during publish is field-anchored too (it previously kept
    only the message).

  This is the server half of "surface validation at the save/publish moment, on
  the field" — the Studio can now map each issue back to its input instead of
  showing a wall-of-text banner. Purely additive to the error payload; the only
  behavior change is the more-correct 422 (was 400) for a failed metadata save.

- 806a40a: Stop runtime view personalization from permanently removing views from the switcher.

  A console personalization PUT (grid column sort, inline edit, …) sends only the raw
  view config — no top-level `viewKind`/`object`. Persisted verbatim, the overlay row
  replaced the flattened package entry wholesale on read, stripping the identity fields
  every switcher-style consumer filters on (`viewKind && object`) — one sort click and
  the view vanished until the DB row was deleted (#2555).

  Two independent guards: `saveMetaItem` now inherits the missing `viewKind`/`object`/
  `label` from the registry entry the overlay shadows before persisting, and
  `getMetaItems` heals identity-less rows already in the DB the same way on read. The
  overlay's own fields always win; `defineView` container bodies are untouched.

### Minor Changes

- 13dbcf2: Extract metadata management into `@objectstack/metadata-protocol` (ADR-0076)

  `protocol.ts` (the `ObjectStackProtocol` implementation — sys_metadata CRUD, draft/publish, locks, package ownership, diagnostics) plus its `sys-metadata-repository`, `metadata-diagnostics`, `seed-loader`, and `build-probes` helpers were metadata-domain code that lived inside `@objectstack/objectql` for historical reasons. They now live in a dedicated **`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`** package.

  The protocol no longer depends on the concrete `ObjectQL` class — it is typed against an injected `MetadataHostEngine` interface (the engine is still injected at runtime). Dependency direction is now one-way (`objectql → metadata-protocol`); there is no cycle.

  **Non-breaking**: `@objectstack/objectql` re-exports every previously public symbol (`ObjectStackProtocolImplementation`, `SysMetadataRepository`, `SysMetadataEngine`, `SeedLoaderService`, `runBuildProbes`, …), so existing imports keep working.

  This is Step 1 of ADR-0076. A later step turns the protocol into a capability plugin so `objectql` itself stops depending on it (making the engine lean by construction).

  Also adds a lean **`@objectstack/objectql/core`** entry — the engine/registry/hooks/validation surface only, with no kernel plugin or metadata protocol — so a thin embedder can import just the engine and never pull `@objectstack/metadata-protocol` into its bundle. A boundary ratchet test guards the entry.
