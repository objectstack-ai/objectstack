- 2e836de: chore(packaging): CHANGELOG.md ships in every npm tarball (#4261)

  The AGENTS.md post-task checklist requires breaking changesets to carry their
  FROM → TO migration because "this text ships to consumers as `CHANGELOG.md`
  inside the npm package and is what an upgrading agent greps after the tombstone
  error." That delivery path was severed for 68 of the 69 publishable packages:
  npm packs `package.json` / `README*` / `LICENSE*` unconditionally but — unlike
  older npm versions — not `CHANGELOG.md`, and the canonical
  `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]` whitelist never named it. Measured on npm
  10.9.7: `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/types` shipped 3 files while its
  70KB `CHANGELOG.md` stayed behind. Only `@objectstack/spec` listed it
  explicitly.

  The tombstone-error scenario is precisely the one where the repo is out of
  reach — the upgrading agent has `node_modules` and nothing else — so the
  migration text has to ride in the tarball. Every publishable package now
  declares `CHANGELOG.md` in `files`, and the canonical whitelist is
  `["dist", "README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]`.

  The other half is the gate: `check:published-files` gains a fifth invariant,
  COMPLETE — a whitelist that fails to cover `CHANGELOG.md` fails the
  always-required lint job, so the next package cannot silently sever the path
  again. `@objectstack/spec`'s per-package EXTRA_ENTRIES exemption dissolves
  into the canonical set.

  Consumer-visible change: one more file per install (the package's changelog,
  e.g. 70.8KB for `@objectstack/types`), and `grep -r "removed key"
node_modules/@objectstack/*/CHANGELOG.md` now finds the migration it was
  promised.

- cc2de0e: chore(packaging): 20 packages stop publishing their sources, tests and build tooling (#4248)

  These 20 packages declared no `files` field, so npm fell back to packing the
  whole package directory. `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/plugin-webhooks`
  listed **21 files** — 15 under `src/`, three of them unit tests
  (`auto-enqueuer.test.ts`, `bootstrap-declared-webhooks.test.ts`, …), plus the
  build-time `scripts/i18n-extract.config.ts`. `dist/` lands on top of that at
  publish time rather than instead of it, so consumers were installing the
  TypeScript sources and the test suite alongside the artifact they asked for.

  Each now declares `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]`, matching the 29 packages
  that already did. Nothing a consumer imports moves: every `main` / `types` /
  `exports` target in all 20 already resolved inside `dist/`, which the new
  `check:published-files` guard verifies rather than assumes. The visible change
  is a smaller install and a smaller dependency-scanning surface — `npm pack` on
  `@objectstack/plugin-webhooks` now yields 2 files plus `dist/`.

  The other half of the fix is the gate. Half the packages declaring `files` and
  half not was the #3786 shape — a hand-copied convention with nothing enforcing
  it, where whoever forgets the line gets no signal at all. `check:published-files`
  (new, wired into the always-required `lint` job) holds every non-private
  workspace package to four invariants: `files` is **declared**; it is
  **sufficient** (covers every entry point, so tightening a whitelist cannot ship
  a package that fails to resolve); it is **minimal** (admits no test, test-harness
  config or build script); and anything beyond `dist` + `README.md` is
  **registered** with a reason, reconciled in both directions so a stale exemption
  is an error rather than dead text. `@objectstack/spec` is the one package with
  registered extras — its `.zod.ts` sources, JSON Schemas, liveness ledgers and
  `CHANGELOG.md` are product, not build input.

  This also closes an assumption #4206 was resting on. Excluding `<pkg>/scripts/**`
  from the docs-drift implementation test is sound only while no package publishes
  `scripts/` as runtime code; that held, but it held because someone read all three
  offenders by hand. It is now checked on every PR.

### Minor Changes

- 012c046: ADR-0080 M3b: hoist the constrained JSX-source → SchemaNode compiler into framework as `@objectstack/sdui-parser` (its canonical home — pure, isomorphic, zero React). Parse, never execute: whitelist-sanitizing parser + manifest validation + `JSX.IntrinsicElements` codegen. Consumed server-side by the (forthcoming) `os build` save-gate for `kind:'jsx'` pages, and re-exportable by `@object-ui/sdui-parser` on the client.
