/**
 * `ManifestInput.of`, the coarse MEMBER kind — the objectui#8067 mechanism,
 * ported into this copy in lockstep (objectstack#17645).
 *
 * WHY THESE PINS EXIST HERE. Two copies of this parser exist — objectui's
 * `packages/sdui-parser` (which the browser RENDERER runs) and this hoisted one
 * (which the SAVE GATE runs). These pins are the objectstack half of the
 * lockstep for the member check; the ported functions are byte-equal to
 * objectui's. Before this port `of` did not exist in this copy at all: a member
 * that drifted from the contract was invisible here while objectui reported it,
 * so the same authored page produced a diagnostic on one surface and silence on
 * the other — the dialect split the lockstep invariant forbids (both copies
 * agree on the accepted grammar AND on diagnostic codes).
 *
 * WHY THE KEY EXISTS. `type: 'array'` said a value was a list and stopped
 * there, so a member that drifted from the contract was invisible to every
 * layer that reads a declaration. `page:header.actions` is the measured cost:
 * spec `z.array(z.string())` ("Action IDs"), a renderer reading the members as
 * `ActionDef` OBJECTS, and the repo-wide parity gate green for the whole life of
 * the drift because both sides had the key and neither could say what was
 * inside it.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED HERE, and they are different facts:
 *
 *  1. THE READER EXISTS — a member no declared arm accepts is REPORTED. A key
 *     that nothing reads is a declared-but-inert key with a new name, which is
 *     the defect this repo's enforce-or-remove rule exists to refuse.
 *  2. BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY — an input that declares no `of` is validated,
 *     serialized and typed byte-identically to before the key existed. That is
 *     what makes this an extension of `sdui.manifest.json` rather than a new
 *     version of it.
 *  3. THE COARSE CEILING HOLDS ONE LEVEL DOWN — `of` names a KIND, never a
 *     domain and never a member's KEYS, so `of: 'object'` clears every object
 *     whatever it contains. The maintainer ruling of 2026-08-17 ("SPEC IS THE
 *     SOLE JUDGE OF VALUES") is untouched.
 *  4. THE OTHER CONSUMERS — the serializer canonicalizes `of` exactly as it
 *     canonicalizes `type`, and the JSX codegen narrows the emitted element
 *     type from it. A member kind the validator honours but the `.d.ts`
 *     contradicts would just move an author's false error one layer over.
