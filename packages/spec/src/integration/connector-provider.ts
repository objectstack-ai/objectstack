 * Connector **provider** contract (ADR-0096).

 * A provider is a *generic executor* — `openapi` (ADR-0023), `mcp` (ADR-0024),
 * `rest`, … — contributed by a connector plugin as a **factory**. At boot the
 * automation service resolves each declarative provider-bound `connectors:`
 * entry by invoking the matching factory, which turns the entry's declarative
 * inputs into the same `{ def, handlers }` bundle a hand-written connector hands
 * to `registerConnector`. The registry, the `connector_action` node, and the
 * `GET /connectors` discovery route then see a finished connector — they never
 * know it was materialized from stack metadata (ADR-0096 §2).
 *
 * These are pure types (no logic — Prime Directive #2) so a connector plugin can
 * implement a provider factory depending only on `@objectstack/spec`, with no
 * runtime coupling to `@objectstack/service-automation` (mirrors how the plugins
 * already avoid importing the engine, using a structural registry surface).

 * already produce (`createOpenApiConnector` / `createRestConnector` / MCP).
