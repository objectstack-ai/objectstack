## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fa011d8: feat(studio): metadata history timeline viewer

  Adds a new `history` view mode that surfaces the audit timeline produced by `sys_metadata_history` (ADR-0008 §5) inside Studio. Available for every metadata type as a wildcard built-in plugin.

  - `@objectstack/spec`: extend `ViewModeSchema` with `'history'`.
  - `@objectstack/studio`: new `historyViewerPlugin` rendering an event timeline (create/update/delete/rename) with op icons, short hash, actor, source, expandable detail panel. ADR-0009 `executionPinned` types (`flow`, `workflow`, `approval`) show a "Pinned" badge explaining that historical versions are retained for in-flight executions.

  Reads from the existing `GET /meta/:type/:name/history` REST endpoint via `client.meta.getHistory()`; no new server surface.

### Patch Changes

- bab2b20: feat(approvals): execution-pinned approval processes (ADR-0009)

  When an approval request is submitted, the engine now records a `process_hash`
  on `sys_approval_request` — the sha256 of the approval process body resolved
  through `MetadataRepository`. While the request is in flight, `approve` /
  `reject` / `recall` resolve the pinned process body via
  `MetadataRepository.getByHash`. Upgrading the approval process definition
  mid-flight therefore no longer affects requests that already started against
  the previous version.

  Behavior:

  - `sys_approval_request` gains a `process_hash` column (text, nullable,
    read-only). Existing rows keep working — the engine falls back to the
    current `sys_approval_process` projection when the column is empty.
  - `ApprovalServiceOptions` accepts an optional `metadataRepo`. When omitted
    (e.g. defining processes purely through the runtime API or in unit tests),
    pinning is silently disabled and the service behaves as before.
  - `ApprovalsServicePlugin` looks up the metadata service from the kernel
    and wires its repository automatically.
  - The metadata-core local `MetadataTypeSchema` enum was realigned with the
    canonical `@objectstack/spec/kernel` enum (drift fix: `approval`, `field`,
    `function`, `service`, …).

  This is the first user-visible consumer of the `executionPinned` capability
  introduced in ADR-0009.

- b806f58: Scope `sys_user` visibility to fellow organization members.

  The default RLS policy on `sys_user` was `id = current_user.id`, which meant
  @-mention pickers, owner/assignee lookups, reviewer selectors and the user
  roster all returned just the current user. The RLS compiler doesn't support
  subqueries, so a `id IN (SELECT user_id FROM sys_member ...)` policy isn't
  expressible.

  This change:

  1. Pre-resolves `org_user_ids` (the IDs of all users in the active org) into
     `ExecutionContext` in **all three** REST entry-point resolvers
     (`@objectstack/rest`, `@objectstack/runtime`, `@objectstack/plugin-hono-server`).
  2. Adds the field to `ExecutionContextSchema` so it survives Zod parsing.
  3. Adds an `org_user_ids` field to the RLS compiler's user context.
  4. Adds a new `sys_user_org_members` policy (`id IN (current_user.org_user_ids)`)
     to both `member_default` and `viewer_readonly` permission sets, alongside
     the existing `sys_user_self` policy. The RLS compiler OR-combines them, so
     users see themselves AND their org collaborators.

  Capped at 1000 members per request. Large enterprises should plug in a
  directory cache or split per workspace.

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 75f4ee6: feat(metadata): introduce `executionPinned` capability for runtime version pinning (ADR-0009)

  Adds a new capability flag on the metadata type registry so that types whose runtime
  transaction rows reference a specific historical version (flow, workflow, approval)
  get unified pinning behavior — instead of every business table re-implementing its
  own snapshot column.

  - `MetadataTypeRegistryEntrySchema` gains `executionPinned: boolean`, enforced
    invariant `executionPinned ⇒ supportsVersioning`.
  - `flow`, `workflow`, `approval` flipped to `executionPinned: true`. `approval`
    also corrected to `supportsVersioning: true` (it was wrongly `false`).
  - `MetadataRepository.getByHash(ref, hash)` added to the interface. Production
    implementation in `SysMetadataRepository` resolves historical bodies through
    `sys_metadata_history` keyed by `(organization_id, type, name, checksum)`.
    In-memory and FS repositories serve HEAD-only matches.
  - `sys_metadata_history` gains an index on `(organization_id, type, name, checksum)`
    to keep hash lookups O(log n).
  - `HistoryCleanupManager` skips pinned types entirely (both age-based and
    count-based retention) — pinned-type history must never be GC'd.

  See `docs/adr/0009-execution-pinned-metadata.md` for full rationale and the
  list of rejected alternatives (no shared snapshot table, no inlined snapshot column).

- 823d559: Remove `sys_metadata_history.metadata_id` column.

  The column was originally a `Field.lookup` FK into `sys_metadata.id`,
  then downgraded to plain `text` during the M1 history-writes work so
  that DELETE tombstones could keep an orphaned ref. After M1 we
  concluded the column carries no business value:

  - Audit-time joins use `(organization_id, type, name, version)`,
    which is already a UNIQUE composite key.
  - The physical row id is a database-internal detail with no logical
    identity — it cannot follow an item through delete + recreate.
  - No code reader was ever added.

  This release removes the column outright:

  - Dropped `metadata_id` from `SysMetadataHistoryObject`
    (`@objectstack/platform-objects`).
  - Dropped `metadataId` from `MetadataHistoryRecordSchema`
    (`@objectstack/spec`).
  - `SysMetadataRepository.put`/`delete` no longer write the column.
  - Legacy `DatabaseLoader.createHistoryRecord` no longer writes it;
    `getHistoryRecord`/`queryHistory` filter by `(type, name)` directly
    (no parent-row lookup needed).
  - `MetadataHistoryCleanup` `maxVersions` policy groups by
    `(type, name)` instead of `metadata_id`.

  **Migration**: Drop the column from existing `sys_metadata_history`
  tables in a follow-up SQL migration. Existing history rows remain
  queryable since `(organization_id, type, name, version)` is already
  the canonical lookup key. No consumer code should be reading
  `metadata_id` — if you are, switch to `(organization_id, type, name,
version)`.

  See ADR-0008 §14 for the full rationale.

## 5.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f9073a: Add `_sections` to `ObjectTranslationData` so per-section labels on detail
  pages can be authored alongside `_views` and `_actions`. Convention:
  `objects.<object>._sections.<section_name>.label`. Consumed by
  `@object-ui/plugin-detail` when sections declare a stable `name`.

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2869891: feat: Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) via `If-Match`

  Update and Delete requests now accept an optional version token. When supplied,
  the protocol compares it against the record's current `updated_at` (or `version`
  column when available) and rejects with `409 CONCURRENT_UPDATE` on mismatch,
  preventing silent overwrites when two clients edit the same record.

  **Wire formats** (opt-in, all server- and client-backward-compatible):

  - `PATCH /data/{object}/{id}` — supports `If-Match: "<token>"` header
    _or_ `expectedVersion: "<token>"` body field (body wins when both present).
  - `DELETE /data/{object}/{id}` — supports `If-Match` header _or_
    `?expectedVersion=...` query param.
  - Conflict response: `409 { error, code: 'CONCURRENT_UPDATE', currentVersion,
currentRecord }` so the client can offer Reload / Overwrite / Cancel UX.

  **Behaviour**

  - Missing/empty version → no check (legacy callers unaffected).
  - Record not found during the version probe → no check; the downstream write
    produces a normal `404`.
  - Object has no `updated_at` column → no check (explicit opt-out for objects
    without timestamps).
  - Quoted RFC-7232 tokens (`"…"`) are accepted and unquoted before comparison.

  **Client**

  `client.data.update(resource, id, data, { ifMatch })` and
  `client.data.delete(resource, id, { ifMatch })` now forward the token as an
  `If-Match` header.

  Application-level CAS (findOne + compare in protocol.ts) is used in this slice
  to avoid touching every storage driver. A small TOCTOU window remains; for the
  B2B record-editing latencies this protects against, it is more than sufficient.
  Drivers may later be upgraded to atomic `WHERE id=? AND updated_at=?` writes
  for true CAS without changing the public API.

  Tests: 7 new cases in `protocol-data.test.ts` cover opt-in, match, mismatch,
  quote-stripping, no-timestamps, empty-token, and the delete path.

## 4.1.1

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 23db640: `record:highlights` now accepts richer field items.

  Each entry in `fields` may be either a bare field name (backward compatible) or an object `{ name, label?, icon?, type? }` that lets the schema override the displayed label, attach a Lucide icon, or force a specific cell renderer without editing the underlying object metadata. Useful when the same field appears in multiple highlight strips with different framing (e.g. "Annual Revenue" vs "ARR") or when you want a tiny icon for status-like fields.

### Patch Changes

- 2108c30: `ActionParamSchema.required` now defaults to `false` (was effectively `undefined`). Functionally equivalent for existing consumers (which check truthiness), but makes the parsed object shape complete and unblocks downstream type narrowing. Fixes pre-existing failing test `action.test.ts > should accept minimal action parameter`.

## 4.0.0

### Minor Changes

- f08ffc3: Fix discovery API endpoint routing and protocol consistency.

  **Discovery route standardization:**

  - All adapters (Express, Fastify, Hono, NestJS, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit) now mount the discovery endpoint at `{prefix}/discovery` instead of `{prefix}` root.
  - `.well-known/objectstack` redirects now point to `{prefix}/discovery`.
  - Client `connect()` fallback URL changed from `/api/v1` to `/api/v1/discovery`.
  - Runtime dispatcher handles both `/discovery` (standard) and `/` (legacy) for backward compatibility.

  **Schema & route alignment:**

  - Added `storage` (service: `file-storage`) and `feed` (service: `data`) routes to `DEFAULT_DISPATCHER_ROUTES`.
  - Added `feed` and `discovery` fields to `ApiRoutesSchema`.
  - Unified `GetDiscoveryResponseSchema` with `DiscoverySchema` as single source of truth.
  - Client `getRoute('feed')` fallback updated from `/api/v1/data` to `/api/v1/feed`.

  **Type safety:**

  - Extracted `ApiRouteType` from `ApiRoutes` keys for type-safe client route resolution.
  - Removed `as any` type casting in client route access.

- e0b0a78: Deprecate DataEngineQueryOptions in favor of QueryAST-aligned EngineQueryOptions.

  Engine, Protocol, and Client now use standard QueryAST parameter names:

  - `filter` → `where`
  - `select` → `fields`
  - `sort` → `orderBy`
  - `skip` → `offset`
  - `populate` → `expand`
  - `top` → `limit`

  The old DataEngine\* schemas and types are preserved with `@deprecated` markers for backward compatibility.

## 3.3.1

### Minor Changes

- AI Agent/Skill/Tool metadata protocol refactoring (aligned with Salesforce Agentforce, Microsoft Copilot Studio, ServiceNow Now Assist)
  - **Tool as first-class metadata** (`src/ai/tool.zod.ts`): `ToolSchema`, `ToolCategorySchema`, `defineTool()` factory. Fields: name, label, description, category, parameters (JSON Schema), outputSchema, objectName, requiresConfirmation, permissions, active, builtIn.
  - **Skill as ability group** (`src/ai/skill.zod.ts`): `SkillSchema`, `SkillTriggerConditionSchema`, `defineSkill()` factory. Fields: name, label, description, instructions, tools (tool name references), triggerPhrases, triggerConditions, permissions, active.
  - **Agent protocol updated**: Added `skills: string[]` for Agent→Skill→Tool architecture; existing `tools` retained as backward-compatible fallback. Added `permissions: string[]` for access control.
  - **Metadata registry**: `tool` and `skill` registered as first-class metadata types in `MetadataTypeSchema` and `DEFAULT_METADATA_TYPE_REGISTRY` (domain: `ai`, filePatterns: `**/*.tool.ts`, `**/*.skill.ts`, etc.)
  - **Exports**: `defineTool`, `defineSkill`, `Tool`, `Skill` exported from `@objectstack/spec` root and `@objectstack/spec/ai` subpath.

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 28985f5: **Breaking Change: Strict Validation Enabled by Default**

  `defineStack()` now validates configurations by default to enforce naming conventions and catch errors early.

  **What Changed:**

  - `defineStack()` now defaults to `strict: true` (was `strict: false`)
  - Field names are now validated to ensure snake_case format
  - Object names, field types, and all schema definitions are validated

  **Migration Guide:**

  If you have existing code that violates naming conventions:

  ```typescript
  // Before (would silently accept invalid names):
  defineStack({
    manifest: {...},
    objects: [{
      name: 'my_object',
      fields: {
        firstName: { type: 'text' }  // ❌ Invalid: camelCase
      }
    }]
  });

  // After (will throw validation error):
  // Error: Field names must be lowercase snake_case

  // Fix: Use snake_case
  defineStack({
    manifest: {...},
    objects: [{
      name: 'my_object',
      fields: {
        first_name: { type: 'text' }  // ✅ Valid: snake_case
      }
    }]
  });
  ```

  **Temporary Workaround:**

  If you need to temporarily disable validation while fixing your code:

  ```typescript
  defineStack(config, { strict: false }); // Bypass validation
  ```

  **Why This Change:**

  1. **Catches Errors Early**: Invalid field names caught during development, not runtime
  2. **Enforces Conventions**: Ensures consistent snake_case naming across all projects
  3. **Prevents AI Hallucinations**: AI-generated objects must follow proper conventions
  4. **Database Compatibility**: snake_case prevents case-sensitivity issues in queries

  **Impact:**

  - Projects with properly named fields (snake_case): ✅ No changes needed
  - Projects with camelCase/PascalCase fields: ⚠️ Must update field names or use `strict: false`
