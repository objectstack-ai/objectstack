## 9.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 1817845: reportForm now matches the 9.0 dataset-bound ReportSchema (ADR-0021): the authoring form declares `dataset` / `values` / `rows` / `runtimeFilter` instead of the removed query-form fields (`objectName` / `columns` / `groupingsDown` / `groupingsAcross` / `filter`), so editors no longer offer fields the schema strips at parse time.

## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4c3f693: ADR-0021 single-form cutover (BREAKING): the inline analytics author surface is
  removed — every dashboard widget, report, and list-chart must now bind a
  semantic `dataset` and select dimensions/measures **by name**.

  Removed from the spec:

  - **DashboardWidget** — `object`, `categoryField`, `categoryGranularity`,
    `valueField`, `aggregate`, `measures` (and the `WidgetMeasure` schema/type).
    `dataset` + `values` are now required; `filter` is the presentation-scope
    runtimeFilter; `dimensions` / `compareTo` are retained.
  - **Report** — top-level (and joined-block) `objectName`, `columns`,
    `groupingsDown`, `groupingsAcross`, `filter`. A non-joined report now requires
    `dataset` + `values`; `rows` are the dimensions.
  - **ListChart** — `xAxisField`, `yAxisFields`, `aggregation`, `groupByField`.
    `dataset` + `values` are now required.

  Migration: replace the inline query with a `defineDataset(...)` and reference it
  by name. A flat record listing (the former `tabular` report / inline list) is an
  object-bound ListView (ADR-0017), not an analytics dataset. See
  `docs/adr/0021-analytics-dataset-semantic-layer.md` and the
  `content/docs/guides/analytics-datasets.mdx` guide.

- 1c83ee8: BREAKING: `ChartTypeSchema` drops 8 variant types that only rendered as their
  base chart, so the taxonomy now advertises only families the renderer draws
  distinctly.

  Removed: `grouped-bar`, `stacked-bar`, `bi-polar-bar` (→ bar — no multi-series
  grouping/stacking), `stacked-area` (→ area), `step-line`, `spline` (→ line),
  `pyramid` (→ funnel), `bubble` (→ scatter — no size encoding).

  Kept: bar / horizontal-bar / column, line / area, pie / donut / funnel, scatter,
  treemap / sankey, radar, table / pivot, and the single-value performance family
  (metric / kpi / gauge / solid-gauge / bullet — these render an honest value
  today and gain a dial when a gauge renderer lands).

  Migration: a widget/series using a removed type should switch to its base
  (`stacked-bar`→`bar`, `spline`→`line`, `pyramid`→`funnel`, `bubble`→`scatter`,
  etc.). These can return via an opt-in renderer once a real renderer + data model
  backs them.

### Minor Changes

- 0bf39f1: `queryDataset` now carries each measure's display `label` and `format` on the
  result `fields`, so presentations can show "Tasks" / "$616,000" instead of the
  raw measure name "task_count" / "616000".

  - `AnalyticsResult.fields[]` gains optional `label?` and `format?`.
  - The dataset executor enriches measure columns from the dataset's measure
    definitions (matching `<name>` and `<name>__compare`).

  The format can't be baked into the numeric row value (charts need the raw
  number), so the renderer applies it at display time.

### Patch Changes

- f533f42: Settings namespace environment overrides now use the canonical ObjectStack
  `OS_<NAMESPACE>_<KEY>` form, with no unprefixed aliases. For example,
  `ai.openai_base_url` is now `OS_AI_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and
  `feature_flags.ai_enabled` is now `OS_FEATURE_FLAGS_AI_ENABLED`.

  The AI service now treats a stored or env-locked `provider=memory` setting as
  an explicit override, while the manifest default still leaves boot-time
  provider auto-detection intact.

  The auth plugin now binds the `auth` settings namespace to better-auth runtime
  configuration, exposes an extension hook for provider packages, and includes a
  basic Google sign-in implementation configured either in Setup → Authentication
  or by deployment-level `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### Minor Changes

- b990b89: fix(autonumber): one owner for autonumber generation — the persistent driver sequence (#1603)

  Autonumber values were generated in TWO places: the SQL driver's persistent,
  atomic `_objectstack_sequences` table AND a non-persistent in-memory counter in
  the ObjectQL engine. Because the engine pre-filled the field BEFORE calling the
  driver, the driver always saw a value already set and skipped — so the
  persistent sequence was effectively dead code, and a multi-instance / post-restart
  deployment could mint duplicate numbers from the in-memory counter.

  This makes generation single-owner:

  - **`@objectstack/spec`** — `DriverCapabilities` gains an optional `autonumber`
    flag: "driver natively generates persistent autonumber/sequence values".

  - **`@objectstack/driver-sql`** — advertises `supports.autonumber = true`.
    `bulkCreate()` now fills autonumber fields too (previously only `create()` /
    `upsert()` did), so bulk inserts also draw from the persistent sequence.
    Field parsing now honors either the spec-canonical `autonumberFormat` key OR
    the `format` shorthand (both appear in metadata).

  - **`@objectstack/objectql`** — when the driver advertises native autonumber
    support, the engine NO LONGER pre-fills (it defers entirely to the persistent
    driver sequence as the single source of truth). For drivers without native
    support (memory, mongodb) the in-memory fallback is unchanged. The fallback
    also now reads either `autonumberFormat` or `format`. Record-validation
    exempts `autonumber` fields from the `required` check — the value is
    runtime-owned and assigned after validation, so a required record number is
    never rejected as "missing".

  No metadata changes required. Existing data is respected: the driver bootstraps
  each sequence from the current max numeric tail on first use.

- 99111ec: Field-level conditional rules (CEL): `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`, enforced server-side.

  Add three CEL-predicate field props (over `record`) evaluated on both sides. **Spec**: `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` (`requiredWhen` canonical; `conditionalRequired` kept as a back-compat alias). **Server (objectql)**: the validator now enforces `requiredWhen`/`conditionalRequired` over the merged record (so the rule can't be bypassed by a direct API write), and the update path ignores writes to a field whose `readonlyWhen` is TRUE (keeps the persisted value). `needsPriorRecord` accounts for conditional fields so the prior record is fetched on update.

- d5a8161: feat(spec): resilientFetch — timeout + backoff for outbound HTTP (P1-1)

  Outbound calls in the connectors/embedder were naked `fetch` with no timeout or
  retry, so a slow or rate-limited external API could hang an agent turn with no
  recovery.

  New shared `resilientFetch` (`@objectstack/spec/shared`):

  - per-attempt timeout via `AbortController` (default 30s);
  - exponential backoff with jitter, up to 3 attempts, on network errors / 429 / 5xx;
  - honours a `Retry-After` header on 429;
  - never retries a caller-initiated abort (intentional cancellation).

  Wired into `connector-rest`, `connector-slack`, and `embedder-openai`.
  `connector-mcp` talks through the MCP SDK transport, so it gets a 30s per-request
  `timeout` on `callTool` / `listTools` instead.

  A stateful per-host **circuit breaker** is deliberately left as a follow-up:
  timeout + backoff already removes the hang/no-recovery risk.

- 5cf1f1b: feat(spec): `inlineEdit` on relationship fields for declarative master-detail

  A `master_detail`/`lookup` field can now declare `inlineEdit: true` (plus
  optional `inlineTitle` / `inlineColumns` / `inlineAmountField`) to mean "these
  child records are entered/edited inline within the parent's form". The intent
  lives in the data model: the parent's standard create/edit form then renders an
  atomic master-detail form (object fields + an editable child grid) with no form
  view config and no bespoke page. Use for line-item/composition children; leave
  off for associations (comments, attachments). Renderer support is in objectui.

- 9ef89d4: feat(spec): `FormViewSchema.subforms` for config-driven master-detail

  A form view can now declare inline child collections via `subforms`, so the
  standard create/edit form for an object can render as a master-detail form
  (object fields on top, an editable child grid below, persisted atomically)
  without a bespoke page. Each entry needs only `childObject`; the relationship
  FK and grid columns are derived from the child object's metadata (override via
  `relationshipField` / `columns`). Renderer support: ObjectForm already renders
  `subforms` (objectui), and the ObjectView form path passes them through.

- 9e2e229: feat(objectql): compute roll-up `summary` fields server-side

  The `summary` field type was declared in the spec but never computed — its value
  stayed empty. ObjectQL now recomputes roll-up summaries automatically: a parent
  field whose `summaryOperations` aggregates (`count`/`sum`/`min`/`max`/`avg`) a
  field across child records is recalculated whenever a child is inserted,
  updated, or deleted.

  - **`@objectstack/spec`** — `summaryOperations` gains an optional
    `relationshipField` (the child→parent FK). When omitted the engine
    auto-detects it from the child's `lookup`/`master_detail` field whose
    `reference` points back at the parent; set it explicitly only when the child
    has more than one such reference.

  - **`@objectstack/objectql`** — after `afterInsert` / `afterUpdate` /
    `afterDelete` on a child object, the engine finds the affected parent (from
    the child's FK, plus the prior FK on update/delete so a re-parented child
    updates both), re-aggregates the child collection, and writes the result onto
    the parent's summary field. It runs in the caller's execution context, so when
    a transaction is open (e.g. the cross-object `/api/v1/batch`) the rollup
    commits atomically with the child writes. A small index of child→summary
    descriptors is built lazily from the registry and invalidated on package
    registration.

  Empty collections roll up to `0` for `count`/`sum` and `null` for
  `min`/`max`/`avg`. This lets master-detail forms stop computing parent totals on
  the client — the server is now the single source of truth.

### Patch Changes

- a46c017: feat(ai): actions opt in to being AI tools via an `ai:` block (ADR-0011)

  Realigns ADR-0011 with its original opt-in design. An Action becomes an
  AI-callable tool only when its metadata sets `ai.exposed: true`, which requires
  an explicit, LLM-facing `ai.description` (≥40 chars, distinct from the UI
  `label`). There is no heuristic auto-exposure and no description derived from
  the label — a clean break from the first implementation's opt-out `aiExposed`
  flag, which is removed (no compatibility shim; the platform has not shipped).

  The `ai:` block also carries `category`, `paramHints` (per-parameter JSON-Schema
  refinement), `outputSchema` (summarised into the tool description for chaining),
  and `requiresConfirmation` (overrides the destructive-action HITL default).
  `AIToolDefinition` is extended to carry `category` / `outputSchema` / `objectName`
  / `requiresConfirmation`. The `@objectstack/service-ai` bridge
  (`action-tools.ts`) now gates on opt-in, merges `paramHints`, and emits a lint
  warning when an exposed destructive-looking action asserts itself safe via
  `ai.requiresConfirmation: false`.

- 3306d2f: feat(automation): surface structured-region body steps in run observability (#1505)

  `loop` / `parallel` / `try_catch` previously ran their body, branch, and handler
  regions against a region-local step log that was **discarded** — run logs
  (`listRuns` / `getRun`) showed the container as a single opaque step, hiding the
  per-iteration / per-branch steps that actually executed.

  `AutomationEngine.runRegion()` now **returns** its body steps, and the container
  node folds them into the parent run log via a new `NodeExecutionResult.childSteps`
  field. Each surfaced step is tagged with its **immediate** container via three new
  optional fields on `ExecutionStepLogSchema` (and the engine's `StepLogEntry`):

  - `parentNodeId` — the enclosing `loop` / `parallel` / `try_catch` node
  - `iteration` — zero-based loop iteration or parallel branch index
  - `regionKind` — `loop-body` | `parallel-branch` | `try` | `catch`

  Tagging fills only fields left undefined, so nested regions keep each step's
  innermost container. A failed try-region attempt's partial steps are still not
  surfaced (preserving `try_catch` retry semantics). Fully additive — existing run
  logs and consumers are unaffected.

- bc44195: chore(automation): retire the `workflow_rule` authoring paradigm (ADR-0018 M5 dropped)

  ADR-0019 already removed the Workflow-Rule → Flow compiler (Workflow Rules were
  removed in #1398 and `workflow` was reclaimed for state machines), but the
  `workflow_rule` paradigm tag survived in `ActionParadigmSchema` and on every
  built-in node descriptor. There is no declarative Workflow-Rule authoring view
  to feed, so the tag is now retired: `ActionParadigmSchema` keeps `['flow',
'approval']`, and the `http` / `notify` / `connector_action` descriptors (plus
  the deprecated-alias fallback) advertise `['flow', 'approval']`. Approval
  execution convergence is delivered by the ADR-0019 approval Flow node, not a
  compiler. ADR-0018's status and migration table are updated to mark M3 shipped,
  M4 framework-complete, and M5 dropped.

## 7.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 36719db: fix: AI-built apps are usable immediately — sync new object tables on publish + emit valid kanban config

  Two gaps found by end-to-end testing of an AI-built app:

  1. **A freshly-published object couldn't accept records until a server restart.** Publishing a drafted object registered it in the in-memory registry but never created its physical table (table sync only ran at boot), so inserts failed with `object_not_found` ("no such table"). Added `ObjectQL.syncObjectSchema(name)` (a targeted, idempotent single-object schema sync) and call it from the publish paths (`protocol.publishMetaItem` and `saveMetaItem` mode:'publish', via `ensureObjectStorage`). Best-effort + non-fatal. New objects are now CRUD-able the moment they're published.

  2. **AI-generated kanban views rendered as plain lists** (and sometimes failed validation). The blueprint `viewBody` emitted `list.type:'kanban'` with no `kanban` config; `KanbanConfigSchema` requires `groupByField` **and** `columns`. Added an optional `groupBy` to the blueprint view schema (lenient + strict) and have `apply_blueprint` set `list.kanban = { groupByField, columns }` — using the view's explicit `groupBy` when given, else inferring the object's first `select` field. AI-built kanban views now validate, publish, and carry a real group-by field.

### Patch Changes

- 06f2bbb: fix(ai): make ADR-0033 blueprint authoring work with OpenAI structured outputs

  Two bugs surfaced by a live end-to-end run (Studio chat → blueprint → draft → review → publish) against a real model (OpenAI via the Vercel AI Gateway) — both invisible to the existing unit tests:

  1. **`propose_blueprint` failed against OpenAI strict structured outputs.** `SolutionBlueprintSchema` uses optional fields and a free-form `seedData` record; OpenAI's strict mode requires every property listed in `required` and rejects open `additionalProperties`, so `generateObject` errored (`'required' … must include every key in properties`) and the agent silently fell back to free-text. Adds `SolutionBlueprintStrictSchema` — a strict-compatible mirror (optional → nullable, no `z.record`) used **only** as the `generateObject` output contract. The lenient `SolutionBlueprintSchema` (and every existing consumer/test) is unchanged; the blueprint tools strip the `null`s the strict contract emits so downstream stays clean.

  2. **Tool-only assistant turns failed to persist.** `ai_messages.content` is required, but an assistant turn that only calls a tool has no text, so the insert failed, the turn was dropped, and the next turn lost context (the agent re-proposed instead of applying the confirmed blueprint). `ObjectQLConversationService.addMessage` now synthesizes a readable placeholder from the tool names (`(called propose_blueprint)`) plus a defensive non-empty fallback.

  With both fixes the full plan-first loop runs end-to-end on OpenAI models: propose → confirm → batch-draft objects/views/dashboards/app → review/diff → publish.

- 424ab26: fix(seed): reject object-wrapped relationship references and constrain them at compile time

  Seed datasets resolve `lookup` / `master_detail` references by matching the value
  against the target record's externalId — so the value must be the plain natural-key
  string (e.g. `account: 'Acme Corp'`), never a wrapper object like
  `account: { externalId: 'Acme Corp' }`. The wrapper was silently skipped by the
  loader, fell through unresolved, and reached the SQL driver as a non-bindable value —
  masked on an always-empty `:memory:` DB but crashing on a persistent one with
  "SQLite3 can only bind numbers, strings, bigints, buffers, and null" once seeds re-ran
  as updates.

  - `defineDataset` now constrains reference fields to `string | null` at compile time
    (derived from each field's `type`), so the object form is a type error.
  - `SeedLoaderService` now fails loudly with an actionable message (and drops the value
    instead of handing it to the driver) when a reference is an object — consistent
    behavior across all drivers, no longer silently masked.

## 7.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b391955: feat(ai): blueprint app-building — propose/draft the navigation app, not just the data model

  The plan-first blueprint (ADR-0033 §4) now also designs the **app** (the navigation shell end users open in the App Launcher), so "build me a project-management application" yields an openable app — not just its objects, views, and dashboards.

  - `SolutionBlueprintSchema` (`@objectstack/spec/ai`) gains an optional `app: { name, label?, icon?, nav? }`, where each nav entry targets a created object or dashboard. `nav` may be omitted to auto-surface every object (then dashboard).
  - `apply_blueprint` expands the app into an `AppSchema` body (single-level `navigation` of object/dashboard items) and drafts it last — through the same draft-gated, per-type-validated `stageDraft` path as everything else. It never sets `isDefault`.
  - `propose_blueprint` now asks the agent to include the app and reports `counts.app`.

  Still draft-gated: nothing is live until the human publishes. Scope is basic app-building (one app, flat nav); areas/groups/mobile-nav remain author-it-later via `update_metadata`.

- f06b64e: feat(ai): ADR-0033 Phase C — plan-first blueprint authoring

  For high-level goals ("build me a project-management system") the metadata assistant now designs before it builds. Adds a `SolutionBlueprintSchema` (`@objectstack/spec/ai`) describing proposed objects, fields, relationships, views, dashboards, and seed data with stated assumptions, plus two tools:

  - `propose_blueprint(goal)` — emits a structured blueprint via structured output. **Nothing is persisted**; the agent presents it for conversational confirmation and asks at most 1–2 structure-deciding questions.
  - `apply_blueprint(blueprint)` — only after the human approves, batch-drafts every artifact through the Phase A draft path (`protocol.saveMetaItem({mode:'draft'})`), validated per-type and partial-tolerant (a bad item is reported, the rest still draft). Seed data is reported as proposed, not auto-applied (no runtime `dataset` type).

  A new `solution_design` skill carries the plan-first instructions and is bound to `metadata_assistant` alongside `metadata_authoring`. The shared draft-write primitive is exported from the metadata tools as `stageDraft` and reused, keeping one draft-write path.

- 023bf93: fix(spec): reject unknown top-level keys on `ObjectSchema.create()` (#1535)

  `ObjectSchemaBase` is a plain `z.object({...})` (Zod default `.strip()`), so any
  unknown top-level key passed to `ObjectSchema.create()` — `workflows`, a typo'd
  `validation`/`indexs`, etc. — was discarded silently: no error, no warning, and a
  green `tsc`. Declarative metadata an author believed they shipped (e.g. object-level
  `workflows: [...]`) vanished from every built artifact, dead from day one. This is the
  metadata-shape analogue of ADR-0032's "no silent failure" principle.

  `create()` now rejects unknown top-level keys with a precise, fixable build error that
  names the offending key(s), suggests the intended key on a likely typo
  (`validation` → `validations`), and — for known-confusable keys like `workflows` —
  points authors at the supported mechanism (a lifecycle hook `src/objects/<name>.hook.ts`
  or a top-level `record_change` flow; there is no object-level `workflows[]` field). The
  factory signature also constrains excess keys to `never`, so the mistake is caught at
  `tsc` time as well as at build.

  The non-strict `ObjectSchema.parse()` load path (registry/artifact validation) is
  unchanged.

  Also fixes two platform objects (`sys_secret`, `sys_setting_audit`) that carried
  silently-stripped `views`/`scope`/`defaultViewName` keys: their intended list views are
  migrated to the supported `listViews` field (`type: 'list'` → `'grid'`) so they now
  render instead of being dropped. The `objectstack-data` skill's CRM blueprint no longer
  teaches the non-existent `workflows[]` shape.

## 7.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 955d4c8: ADR-0018 M3: unified `http` / `notify` executors backed by a generic HTTP outbox.

  Promotes a reliable outbound-HTTP delivery outbox into `service-messaging` (the
  raw-callout counterpart to the notification outbox) and routes the Flow `http`
  node through it — closing the "`http_request` is a bare `fetch()` with no retry"
  gap. The five divergent outbound verbs collapse onto canonical `http` / `notify`.

  **`@objectstack/service-messaging` (additive):**

  - `IHttpOutbox` / `HttpDelivery` generic raw-callout shape
    (`source` / `refId` / `dedupKey` / `label` / `signingSecret`), `SqlHttpOutbox`
    over a new `sys_http_delivery` object, `MemoryHttpOutbox`, `HttpDispatcher`
    (per-partition cluster lock, claim/ack/retry/dead-letter), and a shared
    `sendOnce` + 7-step jittered retry schedule.
  - `MessagingService` gains `setHttpOutbox()` / `isHttpDeliveryReady()` /
    `enqueueHttp()`; the plugin wires the outbox + dispatcher at `kernel:ready`.

  **`@objectstack/service-automation`:**

  - Canonical `http` executor — `durable: true` enqueues onto the messaging HTTP
    outbox (retry/dead-letter); otherwise an inline `fetch()` preserving
    `http_request`'s request/response semantics.
  - `engine.registerNodeAlias()` — registers a delegating executor + a
    `deprecated` / `aliasOf` descriptor. `http_request` / `http_call` / `webhook`
    are now deprecated aliases of `http`; existing flows keep running.
  - `notify` descriptor marked `needsOutbox` (its delivery is outbox-backed).

  **`@objectstack/spec`:** `flow.zod` adds `http` to the builtin node-type seed set.

  `plugin-webhooks` cut-over to the shared outbox is a deliberate follow-up.

- b046ec2: feat(automation): BPMN ⇄ structured-construct model mapping (ADR-0031, task 5)

  Add the semantic bridge between the structured control-flow constructs (the
  native model) and the BPMN gateway/boundary/multi-instance vocabulary (kept for
  interop only), at the **flow-model level** — independent of any wire format
  (`automation/bpmn-mapping.ts`):

  - `exportConstructsToBpmn(flow)` expands each construct into its BPMN
    interchange shape — `parallel` → `parallel_gateway` (AND-split) + branch
    regions + `join_gateway` (AND-join); `try_catch` → the protected activity +
    an error `boundary_event` + the handler region; `loop` → its body marked with
    multi-instance loop characteristics — so external BPM tools see a well-formed
    BPMN graph. Each expansion's anchor carries an `osConstruct` extension marker.
  - `importBpmnToConstructs(flow)` folds that BPMN shape back into the constructs:
    exact reconstruction from the `osConstruct` marker (so `construct → BPMN →
construct` is identity), and a best-effort structural fold of foreign
    `parallel_gateway`/`join_gateway` pairs, with diagnostics for shapes it can't
    safely fold.

  BPMN 2.0 **XML** (de)serialization layers on top of this mapping and remains a
  plugin concern (per `bpmn-interop.zod.ts`), out of scope here.

- 2170ad9: client SDK: add `approvals` namespace; remove dead workflow approve/reject surface (ADR-0019)

  ADR-0019 collapsed approval into Flow: approval is no longer a workflow step but
  a first-class **flow node** that opens a request and suspends the run, with a
  human decision resuming the flow down the matching `approve` / `reject` edge.
  The server already exposes this as a dedicated `/api/v1/approvals` surface
  (`registerApprovalsEndpoints`), but the client SDK still carried the old
  approval-on-`workflow` methods, which pointed at routes that never existed.

  - **`@objectstack/client`** gains a `client.approvals` namespace backed by the
    real REST surface:

    - `listRequests(filter?)` → `GET /approvals/requests` (the "my approvals"
      inbox; filter by `status` (single or array), `object`, `recordId`,
      `approverId`, `submitterId`).
    - `getRequest(id)` → `GET /approvals/requests/:id`.
    - `approve(id, { actorId?, comment? })` / `reject(id, …)` →
      `POST /approvals/requests/:id/{approve,reject}` (records a decision and
      resumes the owning flow run).
    - `listActions(id)` → `GET /approvals/requests/:id/actions` (audit trail).

    The approval runtime types (`ApprovalRequestRow`, `ApprovalActionRow`,
    `ApprovalStatus`, `ApprovalDecisionInput`, `ApprovalDecisionResult`) are
    re-exported so consumers can type the namespace without reaching into
    `@objectstack/spec`.

  - **Removed the dead workflow approve/reject surface.** `client.workflow.approve`
    / `client.workflow.reject` and the backing `WorkflowApprove*` / `WorkflowReject*`
    protocol schemas, types, `IProtocolService` methods, and the `/approve` /
    `/reject` entries in `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_ROUTES` are gone — approval decisions
    are no longer recorded on a workflow record. `workflow` is reclaimed for state
    machines, so `getConfig` / `getState` / `transition` are unchanged.

  - Discovery advertises the new route key: `ApiRoutesSchema.approvals`.

- 7648242: Enforce every declared validation-rule type on the write path; trim the three that can't be (#1475).

  The `validations` union advertised nine rule types but only three (`state_machine`,
  `cross_field`, `script`) ran on insert/update — the other six were accepted by the
  schema yet silently did nothing. This closes that gap on both sides: implement the
  synchronous types, and trim the ones that don't belong in a write-path rule.

  **`@objectstack/objectql` (additive):** the rule evaluator now enforces three more
  types, all deterministic, synchronous, side-effect-free predicates over one record:

  - `format` — a field value against a `regex` and/or a named format
    (`email` / `url` / `phone` / `json`). Runs only when the write touches the field
    and the value is non-empty; a malformed regex fails open.
  - `json_schema` — a JSON field validated against a JSON Schema via `ajv` (compiled
    result memoised per schema). Accepts a parsed object or a JSON string; an
    unparseable string is itself a violation; an uncompilable schema fails open.
  - `conditional` — evaluates `when`, then recurses into `then` / `otherwise`. The
    nested rule supplies the message; the outer conditional's `severity` decides
    blocking. `needsPriorRecord` now recurses into conditional branches.

  Adds `ajv` as a dependency and three error codes (`invalid_format`, `invalid_json`,
  `json_schema_violation`).

  **`@objectstack/spec` (breaking for unused declarations):** removes the
  `unique`, `async`, and `custom` validation-rule variants (and the
  `UniquenessValidationSchema` / `AsyncValidationSchema` / `CustomValidatorSchema`
  exports). They were never enforced and each needs I/O or a handler model a
  write-path rule must not carry. Use the layer that already does each correctly:
  uniqueness → a unique index (`ObjectSchema.indexes`, `partial` for scope) or
  field-level `unique: true`; async/remote → the client form layer; custom code →
  a `beforeInsert` / `beforeUpdate` lifecycle hook. Field-level `unique: true` is
  unaffected.

  `examples/app-showcase` demonstrates and verifies each newly-enforced type. See the
  ADR-0020 addendum for the rationale.

- 60f9c45: feat(automation): structured control-flow constructs (ADR-0031) — loop container

  Adopt structured control-flow as the native, AI-authored flow model (ADR-0031),
  choosing representation **(B) nested sub-structure**: containers carry their body
  as a self-contained single-entry/single-exit region in `config`.

  - **spec**: new `automation/control-flow.zod.ts` defining the `loop` container
    (`config.body`), `parallel` block (`config.branches[]`, implicit join), and
    `try/catch/retry` (`config.try`/`config.catch`/`config.retry`) configs, plus
    region well-formedness analysis (`analyzeRegion`, `findRegionEntry`) and
    `validateControlFlow` (single-entry/single-exit, acyclic; bounded loop).
  - **engine**: `registerFlow()` now rejects malformed control-flow regions before
    a flow can run; new `AutomationEngine.runRegion()` executes a body region in
    the enclosing variable scope without touching the shared DAG traversal.
  - **loop executor**: replaces the no-op `loop` stub with a real iteration
    container — binds the iterator/index variables and runs the body once per item
    under a hard max-iteration guard. Legacy flat-graph loops (no `config.body`)
    keep working — the construct is additive.

  Parallel-block and try/catch _engine execution_ and BPMN interop mapping remain
  follow-ups (issue #1479, tasks 3–5).

### Patch Changes

- c4a4cbd: ADR-0032 (phase 1): validate-by-default expression layer — no silent failure.

  Kills the #1491 class where a malformed predicate (e.g. the `{record.x}`
  template-brace-in-CEL mistake) silently evaluated to `false` and made a flow
  "fire" with no effect:

  - **service-automation**: flow `evaluateCondition` no longer swallows CEL
    failures to `false` — it throws an attributed, corrective error; and
    `registerFlow` now parse-validates every predicate (start/decision/edge
    condition) at registration, failing loudly with the offending location +
    source + the fix.
  - **formula**: new shared validator — `validateExpression(role, src, schema?)`,
    `introspectScope`, `CEL_STDLIB_FUNCTIONS` — with schema-aware field-existence
    - did-you-mean. The `{{ }}` template engine gains a formatter whitelist
      (`currency`/`number`/`percent`/`date`/`datetime`/`truncate`/`upper`/`lower`/
      `default`/…) with defined value→string semantics; arbitrary logic in holes is
      rejected. Plain `{{ path }}` stays back-compatible.
  - **cli**: `objectstack compile` validates every flow / validation-rule /
    field-formula predicate against the resolved object schema and fails the
    build with located, corrective messages.
  - **service-ai**: new agent-callable `validate_expression` tool so authoring
    agents self-correct before committing.
  - **spec**: fix the `FlowSchema` JSDoc example that taught the bad
    `condition: "{amount} < 500"` single-brace form.

- 02d6359: docs(automation): document ADR-0031 control-flow constructs; fix dangling reference card

  - **guide**: `content/docs/guides/metadata/flow.mdx` now documents the structured
    control-flow constructs — the `loop` container, `parallel` block (implicit
    join), and `try_catch` (try/catch/retry) — with config examples and the
    region/DAG model. The Node Types table is updated accordingly.
  - **doc generator**: `build-docs.ts` now cards only reference pages that were
    actually generated. Control-flow's schemas embed CEL-expression transforms
    (like `Flow`/`FlowEdge`) and so have no JSON-Schema page; the index previously
    carded every `.zod.ts`, producing a dangling "Control Flow" 404 link. Cards
    now align with `meta.json` (generated pages only).

- 8fa1e7f: Fix the docs generator (`build-docs.ts`) leaking an unmatched `<` / `{` into generated MDX, which broke the `apps/docs` Turbopack build (e.g. a SemVer range `">=4.0 <5"` in a `.describe()` string was read as the start of a JSX tag). Unmatched openers are now emitted as HTML entities (`&lt;` / `&#123;`); union-variant descriptions also go through the escaper.
- 55866f5: Fail loud instead of silently minting an ephemeral encryption key; ship a persistent env-master-key provider as the default (#1507).

  The default `ICryptoProvider` backs every secret-at-rest in the platform —
  encrypted settings (`sys_setting.value_enc`), ObjectQL `secret` fields, and
  runtime datasource credentials. Its key resolution previously fell back,
  **silently**, to a fresh per-process `randomBytes(32)` key (or auto-minted a
  new on-disk key on every boot) when no stable key was available. In an
  ephemeral-FS container or a multi-node cluster, each restart / each node then
  encrypts under a different key, and every previously-written `sys_secret` value
  becomes undecryptable. The failure was invisible at encrypt and boot time and
  only surfaced later as "all my saved passwords / API keys / DB credentials
  fail to decrypt".

  - **Renamed `InMemoryCryptoProvider` → `LocalCryptoProvider`.** The old name
    implied an ephemeral key when the provider in fact persists one.
    `InMemoryCryptoProvider` stays as a deprecated alias for backward
    compatibility.
  - **Added `OS_SECRET_KEY`** as the canonical production master key (32-byte
    hex or base64), the documented production default. `OS_DEV_CRYPTO_KEY`
    remains the dev convenience key.
  - **Fail-loud in production.** When `NODE_ENV=production` and no stable key
    source (env var or a pre-existing persisted file) is available, the provider
    now throws an actionable error at construction instead of generating a key —
    turning silent data-loss into a config error at boot. It never auto-mints a
    key in production. Development and test keep the ergonomic fallback
    (persisted dev key / ephemeral test key).
  - `serve` surfaces the production-key error verbatim and refuses to wire an
    unstable provider for `secret` fields.

  KMS / Vault providers (managed custody, per-tenant keys, automatic rotation)
  remain future/enterprise plug-ins behind the same `ICryptoProvider` seam;
  "your stored secret is still there after a reboot" stays open-source.

## 7.4.1

## 7.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 23c7107: ADR-0020 — converge the three "state machine" declaration shapes to one
  **enforced** `state_machine` validation rule.

  Before this change a record state machine could be declared three ways (a
  `workflow` metadata type, an `object.stateMachines` map, or a `state_machine`
  validation rule) and **none of them were enforced at runtime** — a declarative
  guardrail that was pure decoration, and a hallucination trap for AI authors.

  **Enforcement (`@objectstack/objectql`)**

  - New `validation/rule-validator.ts` evaluates the object's `validations` union
    on the write path: `evaluateValidationRules`, `needsPriorRecord`, and the
    `legalNextStates` introspection helper (all exported from the package root).
  - `state_machine` rules reject illegal `field` transitions on update (with the
    rule's `message`); `script` / `cross_field` predicate rules now also fire
    (they were silently broken on PATCH updates because only the patch, not the
    prior record, was available). The engine plumbs the prior record into
    rule evaluation on single-row update; multi-row (`updateMany`) updates log a
    warning and skip rule evaluation rather than enforce on incomplete data.

  **Convergence / retirement (`@objectstack/spec`) — breaking**

  - Retires the `workflow` metadata type (removed from the metadata-type enum,
    the registry, the schema map, the `workflows` collection key, and the
    plural→singular mapping).
  - Removes the `object.stateMachines` map and the `stack.workflows` array. The
    `state_machine` validation rule is the single canonical home.
  - The XState-style `StateMachineSchema` file is **kept** (still used by the
    agent conversation lifecycle and the discovery protocol); only its role as
    the `workflow` metadata-type backing schema was removed. The optional
    `workflow` **RPC service** surface (`CoreServiceName.workflow`,
    `/api/v1/workflow`, `IWorkflowService`) is kept as a documented follow-up.

  **Introspection (`@objectstack/runtime`)**

  - Adds `GET /metadata/objects/:name/state/:field?from=:state`, returning the
    legal next states for a field (`next: null` when no FSM governs the field,
    `[]` for a declared dead-end) so UIs/agents read the transition table instead
    of re-deriving it.

  **Surfaces (`@objectstack/platform-objects`, `@objectstack/cli`)**

  - Studio drops the standalone "Workflow Rules" nav (state machines are edited
    alongside the object's other validation rules).
  - `explain` no longer lists `workflow` as a related metadata type.

  Migration: replace a `workflow` / `StateMachineConfig` declaration with a
  `state_machine` validation rule on the object (`field` + `{ from: [allowedTo] }`
  transition table), and move any side-effecting actions (emails, task creation)
  into a record-triggered or scheduled Flow (ADR-0019). See the migrated
  `examples/app-crm` flows for the pattern.

- c72daad: ADR-0029 D7 — Setup app navigation contributions.

  Adds the UI-layer analog of object `own`/`extend`: a package can contribute
  navigation items into an app it does not own, so a shared admin app can be a
  thin shell while each capability plugin ships the menu for the objects it owns.

  - **`@objectstack/spec`** — new `NavigationContributionSchema` (`{ app, group?,
priority, items }`) and an optional `navigationContributions` field on the
    manifest.
  - **`@objectstack/objectql`** — `SchemaRegistry.registerAppNavContribution()`
    plus lazy merge in `getApp` / `getAllApps` (by target group id + priority,
    cloning so the stored app is never mutated); the engine wires
    `manifest.navigationContributions` during app registration.
  - **`@objectstack/platform-objects`** — the Setup app becomes a **shell** of
    empty group anchors; its entries for platform-objects-owned objects move to
    `SETUP_NAV_CONTRIBUTIONS`.
  - **`@objectstack/plugin-auth`** — registers `SETUP_NAV_CONTRIBUTIONS` alongside
    the Setup app it already registers.
  - **`@objectstack/plugin-webhooks`** — contributes its `Webhooks` /
    `Webhook Deliveries` entries into the Setup `group_integrations` slot (it owns
    `sys_webhook` / `sys_webhook_delivery` per K2.a), demonstrating end-to-end
    cross-plugin contribution.

  The rendered Setup nav is identical to the former static artifact — just
  assembled from its owners. A disabled/absent capability contributes nothing and
  its slot stays empty (in addition to the existing `requiresObject` gating).
  This unblocks moving each remaining K2 domain's menu out of the monolith with
  its objects.

- f115182: ADR-0019 — App as the consumer-facing unit. The consumer Marketplace surfaces
  exactly one user-visible noun, the App.

  - Adds `CONSUMER_INSTALLABLE_TYPES` and `isConsumerInstallable(type)` (the single
    source of truth for "what a consumer can install").
  - Constrains `MarketplaceListingSchema.packageType` to `CONSUMER_INSTALLABLE_TYPES`
    (default `app`) so a non-App (driver/server/plugin/…) listing cannot be
    represented — the "consumers see only Apps" guarantee is enforced in the data
    contract, not a forgettable query filter.
  - `defineStack()` now enforces **at most one App per package**: a package with
    `manifest.type === 'app'` may not define more than one app — the banned "suite
    contains apps" shape throws with a clear fix (fold into one app with multiple
    tabs, or split into separate packages). Zero apps is allowed; non-`app`
    package types are unconstrained. Non-breaking for existing stacks.

  The package `type` enum is unchanged; the additions are non-breaking. No
  runtime/registry/execution changes.

- 2faf9f2: External Datasource Federation (ADR-0015) — Phase 1.

  Adds the spec foundation and the DDL gate for federating mature external
  databases without ObjectStack ever mutating their schema:

  - `Datasource.schemaMode` (`managed` | `external` | `validate-only`) and
    `Datasource.external` settings, with a cross-field invariant.
  - `Object.external` binding (remote table/schema, writability, column map).
  - Shared error contract: `ExternalSchemaMismatchError`,
    `ExternalWriteForbiddenError`, `ExternalSchemaModeViolationError`
    (stable `code`s) + structured `SchemaDiffEntry` rendering.
  - `driver-sql` DDL gate: schema-mutating DDL (`initObjects`/`syncSchema`/
    `dropTable`) is rejected when `schemaMode !== 'managed'`.

  All changes are additive and backward-compatible (`schemaMode` defaults to
  `'managed'`).

- 2faf9f2: External Datasource Federation (ADR-0015) — Phase 2 (service core).

  Adds the federation service contract, the type-compatibility matrix, and a
  new service package that introspects, drafts, and validates federated
  objects:

  - `@objectstack/spec`:
    - `data/type-compat.ts` — dialect-aware SQL↔field-type matrix
      (`canonicalizeSqlType`, `suggestFieldType`, `isCompatible`) for
      postgres/mysql/sqlite/snowflake/bigquery/mongo.
    - `contracts/external-datasource-service.ts` — `IExternalDatasourceService`
      plus `RemoteTable`, `GenerateDraftOpts`, `ObjectDraft`,
      `SchemaValidationResult`/`Report`.
  - `@objectstack/service-external-datasource` (new): implements the service —
    `listRemoteTables`, `generateObjectDraft` (renders a reviewable
    `*.object.ts` with `// REVIEW:` markers), `validateObject`/`validateAll`
    (structured `SchemaDiffEntry` diffs), and `refreshCatalog`. Decoupled from
    the kernel via injected I/O; kernel plugin registers it as the
    `external-datasource` service.

  REST routes and the `os datasource` CLI commands follow in a subsequent
  slice.

- 2faf9f2: External Datasource Federation (ADR-0015) — Phase 3 spec: `external_catalog`
  metadata type.

  - Registers `external_catalog` in `MetadataTypeSchema` and
    `DEFAULT_METADATA_TYPE_REGISTRY` (system domain, `allowRuntimeCreate: true`,
    not org-overridable).
  - Adds `data/external-catalog.zod.ts` — `ExternalCatalogSchema` /
    `ExternalTableSchema` / `ExternalColumnSchema` for persisting a cached
    remote-schema snapshot of a federated datasource (consumed by
    `refreshCatalog`, the boot-validation gate, and Studio's schema browser).

- ff3d006: Screen-flow runtime — interactive `screen` nodes (suspend → render → resume).

  A `screen` node that declares input fields now suspends the run on entry
  (reusing the ADR-0019 durable pause), surfaces a `ScreenSpec` describing the
  form, and resumes with the collected values applied as **bare** flow variables
  so downstream nodes read them via `{var}`. (`waitForInput: false` forces the
  old server pass-through.)

  - **spec**: `AutomationResult.screen?: ScreenSpec`, `ResumeSignal.variables?`
    (bare vars), `IAutomationService.getSuspendedScreen?(runId)`.
  - **service-automation**: the `screen` executor builds the `ScreenSpec` and
    suspends when fields are present; the suspend/resume plumbing threads the
    screen through `FlowSuspendSignal` → `SuspendedRun` → the paused result;
    `resume()` sets `signal.variables` as bare flow variables; `getSuspendedScreen`.
  - **runtime**: `POST /api/v1/automation/:name/runs/:runId/resume` (body
    `{ inputs }`) and `GET …/runs/:runId/screen`, wired through both the
    dispatcher route table and `handleAutomation`.

  Verified end-to-end headlessly: the showcase Reassign Wizard launches → pauses
  at the "New Assignee" screen → resumes with the input → the task is reassigned.
  The objectui `FlowRunner` UI that renders these screens ships separately.

- 5e831de: Seed data: first-class identity binding + loud failures (fixes #1389)

  Records seeded via `defineDataset` / `defineStack({ data })` can now bind to a
  platform user with `cel\`os.user.id\``(and to the org with`cel\`os.org.id\``),
  which previously never resolved at boot.

  - **`os.user` / `os.org` now actually resolve.** The runtime provisions a
    deterministic, non-loginable system user (`usr_system`, role `system`)
    _before_ any seed runs and binds it to `os.user`, so identity-derived seed
    values resolve even on a fresh boot — before the first human sign-up. The
    human login admin remains a separate better-auth identity and need not own
    seed data. Exposed as the canonical `SystemUserId.SYSTEM` constant.
  - **New `SeedLoaderConfig.identity`** carries the `os.user` / `os.org` subject
    into CEL evaluation (`@objectstack/spec`).
  - **Failures are loud, not silent.** A record whose CEL value can't resolve
    (e.g. a required `cel\`os.user.id\`` with no identity) — or that fails to
    write — is now counted as an error, marks the load unsuccessful, and logs an
    actionable message, instead of being silently dropped.

### Patch Changes

- 58b450b: Make metadata labels follow the active UI language without a page refresh (#1319).

  The client now carries the active locale on every request (`Accept-Language`,
  `setLocale`/`getLocale`), the protocol ETag is locale-aware so cached metadata
  no longer collides across languages, and the `client-react` metadata hooks
  refetch when the locale changes. The `apps/account` console wires its router
  locale through so a language switch relabels server-resolved object/field/view
  labels in place instead of leaving the UI half-translated until reload.

- 82eb6cf: Fix system-metadata translations: locale fallback, app/dashboard localization, and coverage gaps.

  Switching the UI language left many surfaces in English. Three root causes
  are addressed:

  - **Locale fallback (server).** The metadata translation resolver
    (`@objectstack/spec` `i18n-resolver`) now resolves a requested locale
    against the locales actually present in the bundle (exact →
    case-insensitive → base-language → variant), so a request for `zh`
    correctly hits the `zh-CN` bundle instead of falling back to English.
    This mirrors `resolveLocale` in `@objectstack/core` and benefits every
    resolver (objects, views, actions, settings, metadata forms).

  - **App & dashboard localization (server).** Added `translateApp` and
    `translateDashboard` resolvers and wired `app`/`dashboard` into the REST
    `/meta` translation path. App labels, sidebar/navigation group labels,
    and dashboard titles/widgets were previously never localized at the API
    boundary even though the translation data existed.

  - **Coverage & quality (data).** Added translations for the previously
    untranslated platform objects `sys_share_link`, `sys_view_definition`,
    and `sys_metadata_audit` (and registered them in the i18n-extract config
    so future extractions keep them). Replaced English placeholder strings
    left in the `zh-CN` / `ja-JP` / `es-ES` object and metadata-form bundles
    (notably action `confirmText` / `successMessage` prompts). Added the
    missing `es-ES` built-in Settings bundle in `@objectstack/service-settings`.

- 13d8653: Record-change flow trigger — auto-launch flows on data mutations.

  Completes the automation engine's `FlowTrigger` extension point so flows whose
  `start` node declares a record-change trigger (`config: { objectName,
triggerType: 'record-after-update', condition }`) actually fire on the matching
  mutation. Previously the slot was dead — nothing called `trigger.start` — so
  such flows could only run via a manual `engine.execute()`.

  **Engine baseline (`@objectstack/service-automation`)**

  - Redefines `FlowTrigger` around a parsed `FlowTriggerBinding` (flowName,
    object, event, condition, schedule, raw config). The engine parses the start
    node and hands the trigger a normalized binding, keeping trigger plugins
    decoupled from flow-definition internals (mirrors `connector_action` ↔
    `connector-rest`).
  - Ordering-independent, bidirectional wiring: `registerFlow`/`toggleFlow`
    activate bindings; `registerTrigger` retro-binds already-registered flows (a
    trigger plugin wires up on `kernel:ready`, after flows are pulled in);
    `unregisterFlow`/`unregisterTrigger`/disable tear them down.
  - Centralized start-condition gate in `execute()`: the start node's `condition`
    (e.g. `status == 'done' && previous.status != 'done'`) is evaluated once for
    every trigger type and manual runs; false ⇒ `{ skipped: true }`.
  - Seeds `record`, flattened record fields, and `previous` into flow variables.
  - New `getActiveTriggerBindings()` getter + exports `FlowTriggerBinding`.

  **Spec (`@objectstack/spec`)**

  - Adds `previous?` to `AutomationContext` — the pre-update "old" row, so flows
    can gate on transitions.

  **New package (`@objectstack/plugin-trigger-record-change`)**

  - The concrete trigger: subscribes to ObjectQL lifecycle hooks
    (`record-after-update` → `afterUpdate`, etc.), builds an `AutomationContext`
    from the new/old record, and runs the flow. Error-isolated (a flow failure
    never breaks the CRUD write); graceful degrade when the automation service or
    ObjectQL engine is absent (mirrors `plugin-audit`).

  The `schedule` trigger (ticker/cron + `sys_job` lifecycle) is a follow-up.

## 7.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e7c554: **Rename kernel plugin-sandbox permission schemas to remove a naming footgun** (issue #1383).

  `@objectstack/spec/kernel` exported `PermissionSchema` / `PermissionSetSchema`
  (and the `Permission` / `PermissionSet` types) for the plugin-sandbox security
  model. Their names collided with the metadata-protocol permission set exported
  from `@objectstack/spec/security` (`PermissionSetSchema`), making it very easy
  to validate the `permission`/`profile` metadata type against the wrong schema
  and reject every legal payload.

  The kernel symbols are now prefixed with `Plugin` to reflect their specialized
  semantics:

  | Old (`@objectstack/spec/kernel`) | New                         |
  | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
  | `PermissionSchema`               | `PluginPermissionSchema`    |
  | `PermissionSetSchema`            | `PluginPermissionSetSchema` |
  | `Permission` (type)              | `PluginPermission`          |
  | `PermissionSet` (type)           | `PluginPermissionSet`       |

  The metadata `permission`/`profile` types are unchanged — keep using
  `PermissionSetSchema` from `@objectstack/spec/security`.

## 7.2.1

## 7.2.0

## 7.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 47a92f4: Promote `email_template` to a first-class metadata type using the canonical
  `EmailTemplateDefinitionSchema`.

  Previously `email_template` had two competing Zod schemas (Prime Directive
  #8 violation): the legacy `EmailTemplateSchema` (a sub-shape of
  `Notification`) and the richer `EmailTemplateDefinitionSchema`. The runtime
  metadata protocol (`packages/objectql/src/protocol.ts`) and Studio's
  property panel registered the legacy one, which is why all the new fields
  (`name`, `label`, `category`, `locale`, `bodyHtml`, `bodyText`, …) were
  reported as “declared in form layout but missing from schema”.

  This change:

  - Repoints the `email_template` entry in `TYPE_TO_SCHEMA`
    (`packages/objectql/src/protocol.ts`) and in
    `BUILTIN_METADATA_TYPE_SCHEMAS`
    (`packages/spec/src/kernel/metadata-type-schemas.ts`) to
    `EmailTemplateDefinitionSchema`. The legacy `EmailTemplateSchema` is
    kept only as an inline sub-shape inside `Notification`.
  - Adds an `emailTemplates` collection to `defineStack()` input
    (`packages/spec/src/stack.zod.ts`), registers it in
    `MAP_SUPPORTED_FIELDS`/`PLURAL_TO_SINGULAR`
    (`packages/spec/src/shared/metadata-collection.zod.ts`), wires it into
    `ARTIFACT_FIELD_TO_TYPE` (`packages/metadata/src/plugin.ts`) and
    `APP_CATEGORY_KEYS` (`packages/runtime/src/app-plugin.ts`).
  - Rewrites `packages/spec/src/system/email-template.form.ts` for the new
    schema with sections for Identity, Subject, HTML body, Plain-text body,
    Variables, Delivery overrides, Status.
  - Ships three reference templates in `examples/app-crm/src/emails/`:
    `crm.deal_won` (rewritten to canonical shape), `crm.welcome` (new),
    `crm.lead_followup` (new), and wires them into the CRM stack via
    `emailTemplates: Object.values(emails)`.

  End-to-end verified in Studio: list view at
  `/_console/apps/studio/metadata/email_template` shows all three entries;
  the detail view renders the EmailTemplatePreview iframe and the property
  panel cleanly renders every canonical field (no missing-schema warnings).
  `GET /api/v1/meta` now returns the new `properties` set
  (`name, label, category, locale, subject, bodyHtml, bodyText, variables,
fromOverride, replyTo, active, isSystem, description`).

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- dc72172: **Breaking:** Removed `@objectstack/driver-turso` and `@objectstack/knowledge-turso` from the open-core framework.

  The Turso/libSQL driver and its native-vector knowledge adapter now ship exclusively with the **ObjectStack Cloud** distribution (`objectstack-ai/cloud`). Rationale: Turso is used only for cloud/edge multi-tenant deployments — local development uses better-sqlite3 (faster), and the Turso integration is part of ObjectStack's commercial offering.

  ### What moved out

  - `@objectstack/driver-turso` → `objectstack-ai/cloud/packages/driver-turso`
  - `@objectstack/knowledge-turso` → `objectstack-ai/cloud/packages/knowledge-turso`
  - `ITursoPlatformService` contract (spec/contracts/turso-platform.ts) — removed entirely
  - `TursoConfigSchema`, `TursoDriverSpec`, `TursoMultiTenantConfigSchema`, `TenantResolverStrategySchema`, etc. — moved into `@objectstack/driver-turso` (re-exported from cloud)

  ### Framework-side changes

  - `packages/runtime/src/standalone-stack.ts`: `databaseDriver` enum no longer accepts `'turso'`; `libsql://`/`https://` URL detection removed. Cloud builds register the Turso driver via their own stack composition.
  - `packages/runtime/src/cloud/artifact-environment-registry.ts`: dropped `case 'libsql'/'turso'`. Cloud has its own `ArtifactEnvironmentRegistry` that handles Turso.
  - `packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts`: removed `driverType === 'turso' | 'libsql'` branch.
  - `packages/runtime/package.json`, `packages/cli/package.json`: removed optional peerDep on `@objectstack/driver-turso`.
  - `packages/runtime/tsup.config.ts`: removed `@objectstack/driver-turso` from `external`.
  - `packages/spec/src/contracts/index.ts`: stopped re-exporting `turso-platform.js`.
  - `packages/spec/src/data/index.ts`: stopped re-exporting `driver/turso-multi-tenant.zod`.

  ### Migration for open-source users

  If you used `libsql://` URLs or `@objectstack/driver-turso` directly, either:

  1. Switch to `file:` URLs (better-sqlite3 via `@objectstack/driver-sql`) for local/self-hosted deployments, **or**
  2. Use ObjectStack Cloud, which ships the Turso driver as part of the commercial distribution.

### Minor Changes

- 74470ad: **New `account` App for self-service identity management + `App.hidden` shell hint**

  Adds a dedicated **Account** App (`name: 'account'`, icon `user-circle`) that exposes the three end-user identity surfaces:

  - **Two-Factor Authentication** — `sys_two_factor`
  - **Linked Accounts** — `sys_account`
  - **OAuth Applications** — `sys_oauth_application`

  The app declares **no** `requiredPermissions`, so every authenticated user can reach it — unlike Setup, which requires `setup.access` and therefore excludes the default `member_default` permission set. Combined with the C-tier `resultDialog` actions already shipped on these objects (2FA QR + backup codes, OAuth `client_secret` reveal, `link_social` redirect), this replaces the legacy standalone `apps/account` SPA with a single console + metadata-driven surface.

  **New `App.hidden: boolean` field** (`packages/spec/src/ui/app.zod.ts`) hides an app from the top-level App Switcher. Hidden apps stay fully routable and permission-checked; the shell is expected to surface them through the avatar / user dropdown instead. Mirrors the GitHub Settings / Google account chip / Salesforce Personal Settings pattern. The Account app is the first user.

  Wiring: `plugin-auth` registers `ACCOUNT_APP` alongside `SETUP_APP` / `STUDIO_APP` (`packages/plugins/plugin-auth/src/auth-plugin.ts`). The legacy duplicate entries inside Setup's Advanced group are kept unchanged — they remain admin-only for tenant-wide inspection.

  **Follow-up for objectui**: the shell's `AppSwitcher` and avatar `DropdownMenu` need updating to honour `app.hidden` (filter hidden apps out of the switcher; render them as dropdown menu entries). Tracked separately.

- d29617e: Add `Action.resultDialog` for one-shot reveal of API responses

  Some platform operations return values the user MUST copy now because they
  cannot be retrieved later — TOTP enrollment URIs, OAuth client secrets,
  backup recovery codes. Previously these were handled by bespoke account-app
  pages because actions only surfaced a `successMessage` toast.

  This change adds:

  - **`Action.resultDialog`** — describes a post-success modal that renders
    selected fields from `result.data`. Supports `qrcode`, `code-list`,
    `secret`, `text`, and `json` field formats. When set, renderers SHOULD
    suppress `successMessage` and require explicit acknowledgement.

  - **`Action.target` interpolation contract** — formalised TSDoc spelling
    out the `${param.X}` and `${ctx.X}` substitution rules (with mandatory
    `encodeURIComponent` for URL query positions). Used by redirect-style
    actions like `link_social`.

  New / updated platform actions:

  - `sys_two_factor`: `enable_two_factor` now reveals TOTP URI + backup codes;
    added `regenerate_backup_codes`.
  - `sys_oauth_application`: `rotate_client_secret` now reveals the new
    secret; added `create_oauth_application` toolbar action.
  - `sys_account`: added `link_social` toolbar action (type:`url`, templated
    target) for self-service identity linking.

  These let the Setup app cover OAuth-app registration, 2FA enrollment, and
  social-account linking entirely through metadata, removing the last
  must-have reasons to ship a separate `apps/account` SPA.

  Renderer-side work (separate PR in `objectui`): consume `resultDialog`,
  implement `${param}/${ctx}` interpolation, ship `ResultDialog` component.
  See `c-tier-renderer-contract.md` design note.

### Minor Changes

- c8b9f57: Metadata Admin engine — protocol foundations.

  This is the backend half of the unified Metadata Admin shipped in the Setup
  app. The framework now exposes everything the engine needs to render a
  directory tile, schema-driven form, layered diff, references graph, and
  destructive-change confirmation for every registered metadata type.

  - **`GET /api/v1/meta/types`** is now type-rich. Each entry includes
    `{ icon, domain, schema (JSONSchema), allowOrgOverride, allowRuntimeCreate, supportsOverlay, ui? }`
    so the client can render without a second round-trip per type.
  - **`GET /api/v1/meta/:type/:name/references`** scans every registered
    metadata type for pointers to the given item (object fields, view sources,
    flow targets, permission objects, …) and returns the inbound edges so the
    UI can warn before deletes.
  - **`GET /api/v1/meta/:type/:name?layers=code,overlay,effective`** returns
    each layer separately rather than the merged effective document, powering
    the 3-state diff editor (code source / overlay / effective).
  - **Destructive-change detection** on `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name` and
    `PUT /api/v1/meta/field/:name`: rejects field type narrowing, required
    toggled on without a default, removed enum values, etc., unless the
    client opts in with `force=true`.
  - **Env-var registry patch:** `OBJECTSTACK_METADATA_WRITABLE=object,field,permission,view,…`
    flips `allowOrgOverride` on for the listed types at boot, enabling
    runtime overlays for production without re-deploying spec.
  - New guide: **[Adding a Metadata Type](../content/docs/guides/adding-a-metadata-type.mdx)**
    walks through registry entry + Zod schema + optional custom editor.

  Setup app navigation now uses the new component-route variant
  (`{ type: 'component', componentRef: 'metadata:directory' }`) — the temporary
  `/dev/meta` route is removed.

### Patch Changes

- 6e88f77: Auto-persist chat history when a `conversationId` is supplied.

  - `AIService.chatWithTools` and `streamChatWithTools` now write the inbound user turn, each intermediate assistant/tool round, and the final assistant turn to `ai_messages` whenever `toolExecutionContext.conversationId` is set. Persistence is best-effort: failures are warned and never break the chat response.
  - Add `IAIConversationService.update(conversationId, { title?, metadata? })` and a matching `PATCH /api/v1/ai/conversations/:id` route so clients can rename conversations and edit metadata.
  - `ObjectQLConversationService` and `InMemoryConversationService` both implement the new `update` method.

## 6.7.1

## 6.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 430067b: Introduce `IEmbedder` protocol and extract `@objectstack/embedder-openai` plugin.

  **What's new**

  - **`IEmbedder` contract** (`@objectstack/spec/contracts/embedder.ts`) — protocol-level interface for text → vector providers. One contract covers cloud APIs (OpenAI / 阿里通义 / 智谱 / 硅基流动 / 火山 Doubao / MiniMax), local Ollama daemons, and in-process embedders.
  - **`@objectstack/embedder-openai`** — new package. Drop-in for any OpenAI-shape endpoint via `baseUrl`. Ships preset constants for 8 mainstream providers (`createOpenAIEmbedder({ preset: 'siliconflow', ... })`) and pre-baked dimensions for 16+ popular models.

  **Breaking changes (`@objectstack/knowledge-turso`)**

  - `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider` is **removed** — install `@objectstack/embedder-openai` and use `OpenAIEmbedder` instead (identical option shape).
  - `EmbeddingProvider` type alias kept as a deprecated re-export of `IEmbedder` for smoother migration; will be removed in a future major.
  - `HashEmbeddingProvider` is now an alias for the renamed `HashEmbedder` class — no functional change.

  **Migration**

  ```diff
  - import { OpenAIEmbeddingProvider } from '@objectstack/knowledge-turso';
  + import { OpenAIEmbedder } from '@objectstack/embedder-openai';

  - const embedding = new OpenAIEmbeddingProvider({ apiKey });
  + const embedding = new OpenAIEmbedder({ apiKey });
  ```

  For 国内 providers, use presets:

  ```ts
  import { createOpenAIEmbedder } from "@objectstack/embedder-openai";
  const embedding = createOpenAIEmbedder({
    preset: "siliconflow", // or 'dashscope', 'zhipu', 'doubao', 'ollama', …
    apiKey: process.env.SILICONFLOW_API_KEY!,
    model: "BAAI/bge-m3",
  });
  ```

- 4f9e9d4: Settings → runtime bridge: `embedder_*` settings now build a real
  `IEmbedder` and register it as a kernel-level DI service.

  **`@objectstack/spec`**

  - Exports `EMBEDDER_SERVICE = 'embedder'` from `contracts/embedder.ts`
    as the canonical DI token for the kernel-registered embedder.

  **`@objectstack/service-ai`**

  - Adds `@objectstack/embedder-openai` as an **optional peer dependency**
    (matches the `@ai-sdk/*` provider plugins pattern).
  - `AIServicePlugin.bindSettings()` now also:
    - Reads `embedder_provider` / `embedder_api_key` / `embedder_model` /
      `embedder_base_url` / `embedder_dimensions` from the `ai` namespace.
    - Dynamically imports `@objectstack/embedder-openai` and constructs
      an `OpenAIEmbedder` via `createOpenAIEmbedder({ preset, … })`.
    - Registers / replaces the instance under `EMBEDDER_SERVICE`. When
      the operator sets `embedder_provider = none`, the service is left
      unset so adapters can fail fast with a clear message.
    - Subscribes to `settings:changed` for the `ai` namespace so embedder
      swaps go live without restart (mirrors the chat-adapter pattern).
    - Overrides the manifest's fallback `ai/test_embedder` action with a
      live one-shot `embed(['ping'])` round-trip against the form's
      (possibly unsaved) values. Reports vector dims + latency.

  **`@objectstack/knowledge-turso`**

  - `KnowledgeTursoPlugin`'s `embedding` constructor option is now
    **optional**. When omitted, the plugin resolves `EMBEDDER_SERVICE`
    from the kernel at `start()` time — typically the embedder built by
    `@objectstack/service-ai` from the `ai` settings namespace.
  - Explicit `embedding` still wins when both are present (useful for
    tests and multi-embedder setups).
  - Logs `(embedder=<id>, dims=<n>)` on adapter registration so operators
    can confirm wiring at a glance.
  - When neither path resolves, the plugin warns with a one-line hint
    pointing to `Settings → AI & Embedder` and no-ops gracefully (the
    host kernel still boots).

  **Tests**

  - `service-ai`: +5 cases (now 85) covering `ai/test_embedder` action
    registration, `provider=none` warning, missing-api-key error,
    custom-provider-without-base-URL error, and the full happy path
    (mocked fetch → embedder registered under `EMBEDDER_SERVICE` →
    test_embedder action returns vector dims).
  - `knowledge-turso`: new `plugin.test.ts` (+5 cases) covering deferred
    construction, EMBEDDER_SERVICE fallback, explicit-wins precedence,
    missing-both warn-and-noop, and missing-knowledge-service warn.

  End-to-end now possible: operator opens **Settings → AI & Embedder**,
  picks 硅基流动 + paste API key + chooses `BAAI/bge-m3`, hits **Save**.
  Within the same process, `EMBEDDER_SERVICE` is registered/replaced,
  `KnowledgeTursoPlugin` (if started without an explicit embedder)
  picks it up, and subsequent `knowledge.search()` calls embed via the
  new provider — no restart, no env vars.

## 6.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a49cfc2: Add `compareTo` field to `DashboardWidgetSchema` and `variant` / `dashArray` /
  `opacity` to `ChartSeriesSchema` so renderers can express period-over-period
  overlays on metric / gauge / chart widgets.

  `compareTo` accepts `'previousPeriod'`, `'previousYear'`, or
  `{ offset: '7d' | '4w' | '1M' | '1y' }`. The renderer issues a second query
  against the shifted filter and either (a) derives a trend delta for KPI
  widgets or (b) overlays a muted comparison series on cartesian charts.

## 6.5.1

## 6.5.0

### Patch Changes

- Fix: update `package.json` `exports` to use nested `import`/`require` conditions with per-condition `types` fields (e.g. `import.types → index.d.mts`, `require.types → index.d.ts`). This ensures TypeScript with `moduleResolution: "bundler"` resolves to the ESM declaration file (`.d.mts`) which uses explicit `.mjs` chunk imports — eliminating the intermittent TS2306 "is not a module" error that occurred when tsup's DTS worker processed the CJS declaration chain.

## 6.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f8651cc: Knowledge Protocol MVP — protocol-first RAG via adapter plugins.

  **What's new:**

  - `@objectstack/spec` — new `KnowledgeSource` / `KnowledgeDocument` / `KnowledgeChunk` / `KnowledgeHit` schemas (under `@objectstack/spec/ai`) and `IKnowledgeService` / `IKnowledgeAdapter` contracts (under `@objectstack/spec/contracts`).
  - `@objectstack/service-knowledge` — `KnowledgeService` orchestrator + `KnowledgeServicePlugin`. Routes search/index calls to the appropriate adapter, runs **permission-aware retrieval** by re-checking every hit's `sourceRecordId` against the caller's `ExecutionContext` via `IDataEngine` (same RLS that gates plain ObjectQL), and subscribes to `IRealtimeService` for inline record→adapter sync.
  - `@objectstack/knowledge-memory` — deterministic, dependency-free in-memory adapter for dev/tests/reference. Hash-token embedder + brute-force cosine + paragraph chunking.
  - `@objectstack/knowledge-ragflow` — production-grade adapter against the Apache-2.0 [RAGFlow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow) REST API. Plug in your dataset id; ObjectStack handles permission filtering after retrieval.
  - `@objectstack/service-ai` — new `search_knowledge` tool wired through the registry. Threads the LLM caller's actor into `KnowledgeService.search` so retrieval honours RLS automatically.

  **Why this design:** ObjectStack does NOT own chunking / embedding / vector storage / rerank — those are commodity capabilities best handled by mature OSS (RAGFlow, LlamaIndex, Dify, …). What ObjectStack uniquely owns is the protocol + permission-aware orchestration on top.

  See `content/docs/protocol/knowledge.mdx` for the full design.

- f8651cc: AI tools now execute with the end-user's `ExecutionContext`, so the
  existing ObjectQL row-level-security rules automatically scope what an
  agent can read and mutate.

  **What changed**

  - New `ToolExecutionContext` (on `@objectstack/spec/contracts`'s
    `ChatWithToolsOptions`) carries the authenticated actor, conversation
    id, and environment id through to tool handlers.
  - The built-in data tools (`query_records`, `get_record`,
    `aggregate_data`, legacy `query_data`) and the auto-generated
    `action_*` tools now pass `options.context` to `IDataEngine` calls,
    mapping the actor to `{ userId, roles, permissions, isSystem: false }`.
  - Assistant + agent REST routes forward `req.user` into the new
    context automatically — no caller changes required.
  - When no actor is provided (cron jobs, internal callers, existing tests)
    the helpers fall back to `{ isSystem: true }`, preserving today's
    behaviour. **Fully backward compatible.**

  **Why this matters**

  Before this change, an AI tool call ran with system privileges and saw
  every row in the tenant. Now the agent sees exactly what the human
  operator would see — same RLS, same field-level masking, same audit
  trail. This is the foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents.

  **For custom call sites**

  If you invoke `aiService.chatWithTools(...)` from your own route, pass
  `toolExecutionContext: { actor: { id, roles, permissions } }` to inherit
  the user's permissions. Omit it to keep the legacy system-level
  behaviour.

- 0bf6f9a: Add `Portal` metadata kind for external-user UI projections.

  A `Portal` declares a public-facing "site" derived from an existing `App` (or a curated subset of objects/views), with its own theme, authentication mode (anonymous / passwordless / sso), custom routes, and per-route guards. This is the protocol surface for the "customer portal" use case — partner sites, public booking, support knowledge bases — without forking the back-office `App`.

  **New exports under `@objectstack/spec/ui`:**

  - `PortalSchema`, `Portal` — Zod schema + inferred type.
  - `PortalRouteSchema`, `PortalRoute` — per-route configuration (view ref, layout, auth requirement, sharing scope).
  - `PortalAuthModeSchema` — enum of auth strategies (`anonymous`, `passwordless`, `oauth`, `sso`).
  - `definePortal()` — DX builder mirroring `defineApp()`.

  **Stack composition:** `composeStacks()` now accepts and merges `portals` alongside `apps`, `objects`, `views`, etc.

  No runtime / app behaviour change — this ships the protocol contract first so plugins, Studio, and the runtime can land Portal support in subsequent releases.

## 6.3.0

## 6.2.0

### Patch Changes

- b4c74a9: **Actions-as-tools Phase 3 — Human-In-The-Loop approval queue.**

  Dangerous declarative actions (`confirmText`, `mode:'delete'`, `variant:'danger'`) can now be exposed to the LLM safely. Instead of being skipped outright, they are registered as tools whose handler enqueues a pending request and returns `{ status: 'pending_approval', pendingActionId }` to the model. A human approves (or rejects) from Studio's pending-actions inbox; the service then re-runs the exact same dispatcher.

  ### New surface

  - New system object `ai_pending_actions` (id, conversation_id?, message_id?, object_name, action_name, tool_name, tool_input, status [`pending`|`approved`|`executed`|`failed`|`rejected`], result?, error?, rejection_reason?, proposed_by, decided_by?, proposed_at, decided_at?).
  - New built-in Studio view `AiPendingActionView` with `pending` / `executed` / `rejected` / `failed` sub-views and per-row **Approve** / **Reject** API actions.
  - New methods on `IAIService` (all optional, gated on a wired `IDataEngine`):
    - `proposePendingAction(input) → { id }`
    - `approvePendingAction(id, actorId) → { status, result?, error? }`
    - `rejectPendingAction(id, actorId, reason?)`
    - `listPendingActions(filter?) → PendingActionRow[]`
  - New exported types: `PendingActionStatus`, `ProposePendingActionInput`, `PendingActionRow`.
  - New REST routes (auth required):
    - `GET    /api/v1/ai/pending-actions` (`ai:read`)
    - `GET    /api/v1/ai/pending-actions/:id` (`ai:read`)
    - `POST   /api/v1/ai/pending-actions/:id/approve` (`ai:approve`)
    - `POST   /api/v1/ai/pending-actions/:id/reject` (`ai:approve`)
  - New exported predicate `actionRequiresApproval(action)` for Studio's exposure surface.

  ### Wiring

  `AIServicePluginOptions` gains `enableActionApproval?: boolean` (default `false`). When `true` and an `IDataEngine` is available, dangerous actions are registered and routed through the queue.

  ```ts
  kernel.use(
    new AIServicePlugin({
      enableActionApproval: true, // opt in
      apiActionBaseUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
    })
  );
  ```

  ### Internals

  - `actionSkipReason()` accepts `enableActionApproval` + `aiService` in its ctx and stops returning `"requires confirmation"` / `"mode='delete'"` / `"variant='danger'"` when HITL is wired.
  - `registerActionsAsTools()` pre-registers a _bypass-approval_ dispatcher per dangerous tool via `aiService.registerPendingActionDispatcher(toolName, fn)`; approval calls back into the same code path with `enableActionApproval` flipped off, so a single handler implementation serves both proposal and execution.
  - `createActionToolHandler()` short-circuits to `proposePendingAction()` when `enableActionApproval && actionRequiresApproval(action) && ctx.aiService?.proposePendingAction`.

  ### Out of scope (deferred)

  Slack/email notifications, approver routing (any signed-in user can approve in v1), auto-expiry of pending requests, resuming the same LLM turn after approval (operators get a fresh assistant message instead).

## 6.1.1

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 93c0589: **AI v1: Actions-as-Tools** — every declarative UI `Action` of `type: 'script'`
  is now auto-exposed as an AI-callable tool named `action_<name>`. Agents can
  perform business operations ("complete the groceries task") via natural
  language, routed through the same `dataEngine.executeAction()` dispatcher
  Studio uses. This is the write-side counterpart to `query_data`.

  **Highlights**

  - `registerActionsAsTools(toolRegistry, { metadata, dataEngine })` walks every
    object's `actions[]` and registers script-type ones, auto-injecting a
    `recordId` argument for row-context actions and inheriting JSON-Schema
    parameter types from the owning object's fields.
  - Safety filters skip destructive actions by default: `confirmText`,
    `mode: 'delete'`, `variant: 'danger'`, or explicit `aiExposed: false`.
  - New `aiExposed?: boolean` flag on `ActionSchema` for fine-grained opt-out.
  - New `actions_executor` skill bundle subscribes to `action_*` (wildcard
    tool names now supported in `SkillSchema.tools`).
  - The built-in `data_chat` agent now references both `data_explorer` and
    `actions_executor` skills, so users get read + write capabilities out of
    the box.
  - `MemoryLLMAdapter` learned a small two-step heuristic — when it sees an
    action verb ("complete", "start", "clone", ...) it routes to the matching
    `action_*` tool, resolving `recordId` from any prior `query_data` result.
  - New `examples/app-todo/test/ai-action.test.ts` demo proves the loop:
    user says "please complete the groceries task" → agent finds the task →
    agent calls `action_complete_task` → task status flips → `ai_traces`
    records the run.

  **Breaking changes**

  None. `aiExposed` is additive; existing actions remain exposed unless
  they fail an existing safety filter.

  **Phase-1 limitations** (Phase-2 roadmap items)

  - Only `type: 'script'` actions; `api`/`flow`/`url`/`modal`/`form` skipped.
  - No human-in-the-loop approval flow for destructive actions yet.
  - No CEL evaluation of `visible`/`disabled` predicates against agent context.
  - No bulk action support (single-record only).

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- 629a716: # v1 AI Protocol focusing — remove application-template schemas

  The `@objectstack/spec/ai` protocol is reduced to **only the primitives
  the runtime directly consumes**. Eight schemas that described
  application templates or product features (not platform contracts) are
  removed; three more are slimmed to their primitive cores.

  ## Removed (8 files, ~4,700 lines)

  | File                           | Reason for removal                                                                |
  | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ai/devops-agent.zod.ts`       | A specific Agent template, not a primitive. Compose with `Agent + Skill + Tool`.  |
  | `ai/plugin-development.zod.ts` | Specific workflow; same reasoning.                                                |
  | `ai/runtime-ops.zod.ts`        | AIOps is a vertical product, not a backend platform concern.                      |
  | `ai/predictive.zod.ts`         | ML pipeline product (DataRobot/H2O space), orthogonal to metadata-driven backend. |
  | `ai/agent-action.zod.ts`       | 100% conceptual overlap with `tool` + `flow`.                                     |
  | `ai/orchestration.zod.ts`      | Multi-agent plans can be expressed as agents-as-tools. Premature.                 |
  | `ai/nlq.zod.ts`                | NLQ is LLM-native capability + a `query_data` tool over ObjectQL, not a protocol. |
  | `ai/feedback-loop.zod.ts`      | RLHF / training-side concern; not platform-owned.                                 |

  ## Slimmed (3 files)

  - **`ai/rag-pipeline.zod.ts` → `ai/embedding.zod.ts`** (318 → 80 lines).
    Keeps `EmbeddingModelSchema` + `VectorStoreSchema` primitives.
    Removed: chunking strategies, retrieval pipelines, rerankers,
    document loaders, end-to-end RAG pipeline DSL. The `ragPipelines`
    field on `defineStack()` is removed.
  - **`ai/cost.zod.ts` → `ai/usage.zod.ts`** (431 → ~70 lines).
    Keeps `TokenUsageSchema` + `AIUsageRecordSchema`. Model pricing is
    the canonical `ModelPricingSchema` already exported from
    `ai/model-registry.zod.ts`. Removed: budget definitions,
    enforcement, alerts, allocation reports, optimization
    recommendations.
  - **`ai/mcp.zod.ts`** (629 → ~100 lines). Defines only how to
    _reference_ an external MCP server and _bind_ its tools to an
    agent. The MCP protocol itself is owned by Anthropic's published
    spec and the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`; we no longer re-declare
    transport/capability/resource/prompt/streaming/sampling shapes.

  ## Migration

  No production code in this repository depended on the removed
  schemas. Downstream consumers that imported any of the removed types
  from `@objectstack/spec/ai` must:

  1. **Remove the import.** The platform no longer provides these types.
  2. **Define your own application-level shape** in your project / plugin
     if you still need the concept. The primitives (`Agent`, `Skill`,
     `Tool`, `Conversation`, `Embedding`, `Usage`, `MCP{ServerRef,ToolBinding}`)
     are sufficient to express every removed schema.
  3. For RAG: replace `RAGPipelineConfig` with your own pipeline
     description built on `EmbeddingModelSchema` + `VectorStoreSchema`.
  4. For cost: replace budget enforcement with your own service built
     on `AIUsageRecordSchema` records.

  ## Why

  The platform's job is to define **primitives that any AI feature can
  be built on top of**, leveraging the metadata-driven nature of
  ObjectStack. The removed schemas described specific product features
  (DevOps agent, AIOps, RAG pipeline DSL, budget enforcement) that
  should live in plugins or applications — not in the canonical
  protocol. Shipping a 6,245-line AI protocol where 80% of it has no
  runtime implementation creates false promises to integrators.

  After this change the AI protocol is:

  ```
  ai/
  ├── agent.zod.ts          ← who
  ├── skill.zod.ts          ← when
  ├── tool.zod.ts           ← what
  ├── conversation.zod.ts   ← what to remember
  ├── model-registry.zod.ts ← which LLMs
  ├── embedding.zod.ts      ← embedding + vector store primitives
  ├── usage.zod.ts          ← token + cost accounting
  └── mcp.zod.ts            ← external ecosystem bridge
  ```

  8 files, ~1,200 lines. Every schema has a runtime implementation in
  `@objectstack/service-ai` or `@objectstack/plugin-mcp-server`.

- 944f187: # v5.0 — `project` → `environment` hard rename

  The runtime concept previously called **"project"** (per-tenant business
  workspace; Org → **Project** → Branch hierarchy; per-project ObjectKernel,
  per-project DB, per-project artifact) is now uniformly called
  **"environment"**.

  This is a **hard rename with no aliases, deprecation shims, or compatibility
  layer**. Upgrade requires a coordinated update of CLI, runtime, server, and any
  clients calling the REST API.

  > Note: "project" in the npm / monorepo sense (the framework itself, `package.json`,
  > tsconfig project references, vitest `projects` config) is **unchanged**.

  ## Breaking changes

  ### CLI

  - Flags renamed:
    - `--project` / `-p` → `--environment` / `-e` (`os publish`, `os rollback`)
    - `--project-id` → `--environment-id` (`os dev`)
  - Default local env id: `proj_local` → `env_local`.
  - Env var: `OS_PROJECT_ID` → `OS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`.
  - Command group renamed: `os projects ...` → `os environments ...`
    (`bind`, `create`, `list`, `show`, `switch`).
  - Persisted auth-config key: `activeProjectId` → `activeEnvironmentId`.

  ### HTTP / REST

  - Scoped routes: `/api/v1/projects/:projectId/...` → `/api/v1/environments/:environmentId/...`.
  - Cloud control-plane routes: `/api/v1/cloud/projects/...` → `/api/v1/cloud/environments/...`
    (including `/cloud/environments/:id/artifact`, `/cloud/environments/:id/metadata`,
    `/cloud/environments/:id/credentials/rotate`, etc.).
  - Header: `X-Project-Id` (and lowercase `x-project-id`) → `X-Environment-Id`
    (`x-environment-id`).
  - Route param name in handlers: `req.params.projectId` → `req.params.environmentId`.
  - Hostname-routing and tenant-resolution code-paths use `environmentId` end-to-end.

  ### Runtime / spec

  - Exported symbols (no aliases):
    - `createSystemProjectPlugin` → `createSystemEnvironmentPlugin`
    - `SYSTEM_PROJECT_ID` → `SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
    - `ProjectArtifactSchema` → `EnvironmentArtifactSchema`
    - `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_SCHEMA_VERSION` → `ENVIRONMENT_ARTIFACT_SCHEMA_VERSION`
    - `ObjectOSProjectPlugin` → `ObjectOSEnvironmentPlugin`
    - `createSingleProjectPlugin` → `createSingleEnvironmentPlugin`
  - Plugin identifier strings:
    - `com.objectstack.runtime.objectos-project` → `objectos-environment`
    - `com.objectstack.studio.single-project` → `single-environment`
    - `com.objectstack.multi-project` → `multi-environment`
    - `com.objectstack.runtime.system-project` → `system-environment`
  - Provisioning hook: `provisionSystemProject` → `provisionSystemEnvironment`.

  ### Database / schemas

  - Column renames on `sys_metadata` and `sys_metadata_history`:
    `project_id` → `environment_id`.
  - Column renames on `sys_activity`: `project_id` → `environment_id` (plus index).
  - Object renames in platform-objects metadata: `sys_project` → `sys_environment`
    (lookup targets), `sys_project_member` → `sys_environment_member`,
    `sys_project_credential` → `sys_environment_credential`.
  - Auth-context field: `active_project_id` → `active_environment_id`.
  - JSON schemas under `packages/spec/json-schema/system/`:
    `ProjectArtifact*.json` → `EnvironmentArtifact*.json` (regenerated at build).

  ### Automatic forward migration

  A new migration `migrateProjectIdToEnvironmentId`
  (`packages/metadata/src/migrations/migrate-project-id-to-environment-id.ts`)
  auto-runs from `DatabaseLoader.ensureSchema()` on bootstrap and rewrites any
  existing `project_id` column on `sys_metadata` / `sys_metadata_history` to
  `environment_id` (idempotent, best-effort). Existing rows are preserved.

  The legacy reverse migration `migrateEnvIdToProjectId` is retained verbatim
  for historical / disaster-recovery use; it is **not** auto-run.

  ## Migration guide

  ```diff
  -os publish --project proj_xyz
  +os publish --environment env_xyz

  -curl -H "X-Project-Id: env_xyz" https://api.example.com/api/v1/data/customer
  +curl -H "X-Environment-Id: env_xyz" https://api.example.com/api/v1/data/customer

  -OS_PROJECT_ID=env_xyz os dev
  +OS_ENVIRONMENT_ID=env_xyz os dev

  -import { createSystemProjectPlugin, SYSTEM_PROJECT_ID } from "@objectstack/runtime";
  +import { createSystemEnvironmentPlugin, SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_ID } from "@objectstack/runtime";

  -import { ProjectArtifactSchema } from "@objectstack/spec";
  +import { EnvironmentArtifactSchema } from "@objectstack/spec";
  ```

  If you maintain a Cloud control-plane deployment, the `cloud` repository must
  be updated in lockstep to pick up the new plugin identifier strings
  (`single-environment`, `multi-environment`, `objectos-environment`).

### Minor Changes

- dbc4f7d: feat(ai): v1 AI capabilities — ModelRegistry, structured output, tracing, schema retrieval, and `query_data` tool

  This release lights up the first concrete capabilities on the slimmed AI protocol. All additions are
  non-breaking — new contract methods are optional and existing callers keep working unchanged.

  ### What's new

  - **ModelRegistry** (`@objectstack/service-ai`): in-memory runtime registry for `AI.ModelConfig`.
    Wire models via `AIServicePluginOptions.models` / `defaultModelId`. Exposes `get`, `getOrThrow`,
    `getDefault`, `list`, and `estimateCost(modelId, usage)` for ex-post token cost computation.

  - **ai_traces object + auto-tracing**: every LLM call from `AIService` (`chat`, `complete`,
    `stream_chat`, `chat_with_tools`, `generate_object`, `embed`) is now instrumented with latency,
    token usage, status, and (when pricing is registered) cost. The default `ObjectQLTraceRecorder`
    is auto-wired when the runtime exposes an `IDataEngine`, persisting rows to the new `ai_traces`
    object. Drop in a custom `TraceRecorder` via `AIServicePluginOptions.traceRecorder`, or pass
    `null` to opt out.

  - **Structured output (`IAIService.generateObject`)**: new optional method on `IAIService` and
    `LLMAdapter` that returns a parsed, schema-validated object instead of free-form text.
    Implemented end-to-end in `VercelLLMAdapter` (uses the AI SDK's `generateObject` — provider
    strict-mode is automatic when supported). `MemoryLLMAdapter` ships a deterministic heuristic
    implementation so tests and demos work without an API key.

  - **SchemaRetriever**: lightweight keyword-based retriever over `IMetadataService.listObjects()`.
    Scores by object name (×3), label/plural (×2), description (×1), field name (×2), and field
    label (×1) with English stop-word filtering. Tokenisation splits snake_case so `todo_task` in
    a query matches `name: 'todo_task'`. `SchemaRetriever.renderSnippet()` produces a Markdown
    block ready to inject into a system prompt — no embeddings, no extra infra.

  - **`query_data` tool**: auto-registered when AI + Metadata + Data engine are all present. Takes
    a natural-language `request`, retrieves relevant schemas, asks the model for a structured
    `QueryPlan` via `generateObject`, validates the plan targets a real object, and executes it
    through `IDataEngine.find`. Returns `{ plan, count, records }`. The composed primitive that
    closes the loop from "ask in English" → "validated SQL-shaped result".

  - **Working demo in `examples/app-todo`**: `pnpm --filter @example/app-todo test:ai` boots the
    full Todo stack, invokes `query_data` against the seeded tasks, and verifies the call lands
    in `ai_traces`. Zero API keys, ~3 seconds end-to-end. Serves as the canonical reference for
    wiring AI into a real app.

  ### Hardening

  - Strict tool schemas: nested `orderBy` and `aggregations` items in `data-tools` now declare
    `additionalProperties: false` + `required`, matching the top-level contract and making them
    safe for provider strict mode.

  ### Breaking-ish

  - `TraceOperation` values are now snake_case (`stream_chat`, `chat_with_tools`, `generate_object`)
    to match the project's data-value convention and so the `ai_traces.operation` select validates.
    Custom `TraceRecorder` implementations that hard-code the old camelCase names need to be
    updated. The values are an internal observability artefact — no public protocol surface
    exposes them.

  ### Notes

  - `zod` is now a direct dependency of `@objectstack/service-ai` (previously transitive via `ai`)
    because contract signatures and the new tool definition use `z.ZodType` types directly.
  - All new methods on `IAIService` / `LLMAdapter` are optional — existing custom adapters and
    callers continue to work without changes.
  - 12 new unit tests cover `ModelRegistry` (cost math, defaults, throwing lookups) and
    `SchemaRetriever` (scoring, snake_case tokenisation, limits, snippet rendering).
    Full suite: 323/323 ✓.

## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fa011d8: feat(studio): metadata history timeline viewer

  Adds a new `history` view mode that surfaces the audit timeline produced by `sys_metadata_history` (ADR-0008 §5) inside Studio. Available for every metadata type as a wildcard built-in plugin.

  - `@objectstack/spec`: extend `ViewModeSchema` with `'history'`.
  - `@objectstack/studio`: new `historyViewerPlugin` rendering an event timeline (create/update/delete/rename) with op icons, short hash, actor, source, expandable detail panel. ADR-0009 `executionPinned` types (`flow`, `workflow`, `approval`) show a "Pinned" badge explaining that historical versions are retained for in-flight executions.

  Reads from the existing `GET /meta/:type/:name/history` REST endpoint via `client.meta.getHistory()`; no new server surface.

### Patch Changes

- bab2b20: feat(approvals): execution-pinned approval processes (ADR-0009)

  When an approval request is submitted, the engine now records a `process_hash`
  on `sys_approval_request` — the sha256 of the approval process body resolved
  through `MetadataRepository`. While the request is in flight, `approve` /
  `reject` / `recall` resolve the pinned process body via
  `MetadataRepository.getByHash`. Upgrading the approval process definition
  mid-flight therefore no longer affects requests that already started against
  the previous version.

  Behavior:

  - `sys_approval_request` gains a `process_hash` column (text, nullable,
    read-only). Existing rows keep working — the engine falls back to the
    current `sys_approval_process` projection when the column is empty.
  - `ApprovalServiceOptions` accepts an optional `metadataRepo`. When omitted
    (e.g. defining processes purely through the runtime API or in unit tests),
    pinning is silently disabled and the service behaves as before.
  - `ApprovalsServicePlugin` looks up the metadata service from the kernel
    and wires its repository automatically.
  - The metadata-core local `MetadataTypeSchema` enum was realigned with the
    canonical `@objectstack/spec/kernel` enum (drift fix: `approval`, `field`,
    `function`, `service`, …).

  This is the first user-visible consumer of the `executionPinned` capability
  introduced in ADR-0009.

- b806f58: Scope `sys_user` visibility to fellow organization members.

  The default RLS policy on `sys_user` was `id = current_user.id`, which meant
  @-mention pickers, owner/assignee lookups, reviewer selectors and the user
  roster all returned just the current user. The RLS compiler doesn't support
  subqueries, so a `id IN (SELECT user_id FROM sys_member ...)` policy isn't
  expressible.

  This change:

  1. Pre-resolves `org_user_ids` (the IDs of all users in the active org) into
     `ExecutionContext` in **all three** REST entry-point resolvers
     (`@objectstack/rest`, `@objectstack/runtime`, `@objectstack/plugin-hono-server`).
  2. Adds the field to `ExecutionContextSchema` so it survives Zod parsing.
  3. Adds an `org_user_ids` field to the RLS compiler's user context.
  4. Adds a new `sys_user_org_members` policy (`id IN (current_user.org_user_ids)`)
     to both `member_default` and `viewer_readonly` permission sets, alongside
     the existing `sys_user_self` policy. The RLS compiler OR-combines them, so
     users see themselves AND their org collaborators.

  Capped at 1000 members per request. Large enterprises should plug in a
  directory cache or split per workspace.

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 75f4ee6: feat(metadata): introduce `executionPinned` capability for runtime version pinning (ADR-0009)

  Adds a new capability flag on the metadata type registry so that types whose runtime
  transaction rows reference a specific historical version (flow, workflow, approval)
  get unified pinning behavior — instead of every business table re-implementing its
  own snapshot column.

  - `MetadataTypeRegistryEntrySchema` gains `executionPinned: boolean`, enforced
    invariant `executionPinned ⇒ supportsVersioning`.
  - `flow`, `workflow`, `approval` flipped to `executionPinned: true`. `approval`
    also corrected to `supportsVersioning: true` (it was wrongly `false`).
  - `MetadataRepository.getByHash(ref, hash)` added to the interface. Production
    implementation in `SysMetadataRepository` resolves historical bodies through
    `sys_metadata_history` keyed by `(organization_id, type, name, checksum)`.
    In-memory and FS repositories serve HEAD-only matches.
  - `sys_metadata_history` gains an index on `(organization_id, type, name, checksum)`
    to keep hash lookups O(log n).
  - `HistoryCleanupManager` skips pinned types entirely (both age-based and
    count-based retention) — pinned-type history must never be GC'd.

  See `docs/adr/0009-execution-pinned-metadata.md` for full rationale and the
  list of rejected alternatives (no shared snapshot table, no inlined snapshot column).

- 823d559: Remove `sys_metadata_history.metadata_id` column.

  The column was originally a `Field.lookup` FK into `sys_metadata.id`,
  then downgraded to plain `text` during the M1 history-writes work so
  that DELETE tombstones could keep an orphaned ref. After M1 we
  concluded the column carries no business value:

  - Audit-time joins use `(organization_id, type, name, version)`,
    which is already a UNIQUE composite key.
  - The physical row id is a database-internal detail with no logical
    identity — it cannot follow an item through delete + recreate.
  - No code reader was ever added.

  This release removes the column outright:

  - Dropped `metadata_id` from `SysMetadataHistoryObject`
    (`@objectstack/platform-objects`).
  - Dropped `metadataId` from `MetadataHistoryRecordSchema`
    (`@objectstack/spec`).
  - `SysMetadataRepository.put`/`delete` no longer write the column.
  - Legacy `DatabaseLoader.createHistoryRecord` no longer writes it;
    `getHistoryRecord`/`queryHistory` filter by `(type, name)` directly
    (no parent-row lookup needed).
  - `MetadataHistoryCleanup` `maxVersions` policy groups by
    `(type, name)` instead of `metadata_id`.

  **Migration**: Drop the column from existing `sys_metadata_history`
  tables in a follow-up SQL migration. Existing history rows remain
  queryable since `(organization_id, type, name, version)` is already
  the canonical lookup key. No consumer code should be reading
  `metadata_id` — if you are, switch to `(organization_id, type, name,
version)`.

  See ADR-0008 §14 for the full rationale.

## 5.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f9073a: Add `_sections` to `ObjectTranslationData` so per-section labels on detail
  pages can be authored alongside `_views` and `_actions`. Convention:
  `objects.<object>._sections.<section_name>.label`. Consumed by
  `@object-ui/plugin-detail` when sections declare a stable `name`.

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2869891: feat: Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) via `If-Match`

  Update and Delete requests now accept an optional version token. When supplied,
  the protocol compares it against the record's current `updated_at` (or `version`
  column when available) and rejects with `409 CONCURRENT_UPDATE` on mismatch,
  preventing silent overwrites when two clients edit the same record.

  **Wire formats** (opt-in, all server- and client-backward-compatible):

  - `PATCH /data/{object}/{id}` — supports `If-Match: "<token>"` header
    _or_ `expectedVersion: "<token>"` body field (body wins when both present).
  - `DELETE /data/{object}/{id}` — supports `If-Match` header _or_
    `?expectedVersion=...` query param.
  - Conflict response: `409 { error, code: 'CONCURRENT_UPDATE', currentVersion,
currentRecord }` so the client can offer Reload / Overwrite / Cancel UX.

  **Behaviour**

  - Missing/empty version → no check (legacy callers unaffected).
  - Record not found during the version probe → no check; the downstream write
    produces a normal `404`.
  - Object has no `updated_at` column → no check (explicit opt-out for objects
    without timestamps).
  - Quoted RFC-7232 tokens (`"…"`) are accepted and unquoted before comparison.

  **Client**

  `client.data.update(resource, id, data, { ifMatch })` and
  `client.data.delete(resource, id, { ifMatch })` now forward the token as an
  `If-Match` header.

  Application-level CAS (findOne + compare in protocol.ts) is used in this slice
  to avoid touching every storage driver. A small TOCTOU window remains; for the
  B2B record-editing latencies this protects against, it is more than sufficient.
  Drivers may later be upgraded to atomic `WHERE id=? AND updated_at=?` writes
  for true CAS without changing the public API.

  Tests: 7 new cases in `protocol-data.test.ts` cover opt-in, match, mismatch,
  quote-stripping, no-timestamps, empty-token, and the delete path.

## 4.1.1

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 23db640: `record:highlights` now accepts richer field items.

  Each entry in `fields` may be either a bare field name (backward compatible) or an object `{ name, label?, icon?, type? }` that lets the schema override the displayed label, attach a Lucide icon, or force a specific cell renderer without editing the underlying object metadata. Useful when the same field appears in multiple highlight strips with different framing (e.g. "Annual Revenue" vs "ARR") or when you want a tiny icon for status-like fields.

### Patch Changes

- 2108c30: `ActionParamSchema.required` now defaults to `false` (was effectively `undefined`). Functionally equivalent for existing consumers (which check truthiness), but makes the parsed object shape complete and unblocks downstream type narrowing. Fixes pre-existing failing test `action.test.ts > should accept minimal action parameter`.

## 4.0.0

### Minor Changes

- f08ffc3: Fix discovery API endpoint routing and protocol consistency.

  **Discovery route standardization:**

  - All adapters (Express, Fastify, Hono, NestJS, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit) now mount the discovery endpoint at `{prefix}/discovery` instead of `{prefix}` root.
  - `.well-known/objectstack` redirects now point to `{prefix}/discovery`.
  - Client `connect()` fallback URL changed from `/api/v1` to `/api/v1/discovery`.
  - Runtime dispatcher handles both `/discovery` (standard) and `/` (legacy) for backward compatibility.

  **Schema & route alignment:**

  - Added `storage` (service: `file-storage`) and `feed` (service: `data`) routes to `DEFAULT_DISPATCHER_ROUTES`.
  - Added `feed` and `discovery` fields to `ApiRoutesSchema`.
  - Unified `GetDiscoveryResponseSchema` with `DiscoverySchema` as single source of truth.
  - Client `getRoute('feed')` fallback updated from `/api/v1/data` to `/api/v1/feed`.

  **Type safety:**

  - Extracted `ApiRouteType` from `ApiRoutes` keys for type-safe client route resolution.
  - Removed `as any` type casting in client route access.

- e0b0a78: Deprecate DataEngineQueryOptions in favor of QueryAST-aligned EngineQueryOptions.

  Engine, Protocol, and Client now use standard QueryAST parameter names:

  - `filter` → `where`
  - `select` → `fields`
  - `sort` → `orderBy`
  - `skip` → `offset`
  - `populate` → `expand`
  - `top` → `limit`

  The old DataEngine\* schemas and types are preserved with `@deprecated` markers for backward compatibility.

## 3.3.1

### Minor Changes

- AI Agent/Skill/Tool metadata protocol refactoring (aligned with Salesforce Agentforce, Microsoft Copilot Studio, ServiceNow Now Assist)
  - **Tool as first-class metadata** (`src/ai/tool.zod.ts`): `ToolSchema`, `ToolCategorySchema`, `defineTool()` factory. Fields: name, label, description, category, parameters (JSON Schema), outputSchema, objectName, requiresConfirmation, permissions, active, builtIn.
  - **Skill as ability group** (`src/ai/skill.zod.ts`): `SkillSchema`, `SkillTriggerConditionSchema`, `defineSkill()` factory. Fields: name, label, description, instructions, tools (tool name references), triggerPhrases, triggerConditions, permissions, active.
  - **Agent protocol updated**: Added `skills: string[]` for Agent→Skill→Tool architecture; existing `tools` retained as backward-compatible fallback. Added `permissions: string[]` for access control.
  - **Metadata registry**: `tool` and `skill` registered as first-class metadata types in `MetadataTypeSchema` and `DEFAULT_METADATA_TYPE_REGISTRY` (domain: `ai`, filePatterns: `**/*.tool.ts`, `**/*.skill.ts`, etc.)
  - **Exports**: `defineTool`, `defineSkill`, `Tool`, `Skill` exported from `@objectstack/spec` root and `@objectstack/spec/ai` subpath.

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 28985f5: **Breaking Change: Strict Validation Enabled by Default**

  `defineStack()` now validates configurations by default to enforce naming conventions and catch errors early.

  **What Changed:**

  - `defineStack()` now defaults to `strict: true` (was `strict: false`)
  - Field names are now validated to ensure snake_case format
  - Object names, field types, and all schema definitions are validated

  **Migration Guide:**

  If you have existing code that violates naming conventions:

  ```typescript
  // Before (would silently accept invalid names):
  defineStack({
    manifest: {...},
    objects: [{
      name: 'my_object',
      fields: {
        firstName: { type: 'text' }  // ❌ Invalid: camelCase
      }
    }]
  });

  // After (will throw validation error):
  // Error: Field names must be lowercase snake_case

  // Fix: Use snake_case
  defineStack({
    manifest: {...},
    objects: [{
      name: 'my_object',
      fields: {
        first_name: { type: 'text' }  // ✅ Valid: snake_case
      }
    }]
  });
  ```

  **Temporary Workaround:**

  If you need to temporarily disable validation while fixing your code:

  ```typescript
  defineStack(config, { strict: false }); // Bypass validation
  ```

  **Why This Change:**

  1. **Catches Errors Early**: Invalid field names caught during development, not runtime
  2. **Enforces Conventions**: Ensures consistent snake_case naming across all projects
  3. **Prevents AI Hallucinations**: AI-generated objects must follow proper conventions
  4. **Database Compatibility**: snake_case prevents case-sensitivity issues in queries

  **Impact:**

  - Projects with properly named fields (snake_case): ✅ No changes needed
  - Projects with camelCase/PascalCase fields: ⚠️ Must update field names or use `strict: false`
