### Minor Changes

- 5eef4cf: feat(analytics): multi-hop relationship joins for datasets (ADR-0071)

  A dataset's `include` and dimension/measure `field` paths may now traverse up to
  3 to-one relationship hops (`account.owner.region`), not just one. The compiler
  expands each declared path into the ordered join chain (one `cube.join` per path
  prefix, aliased dot-free as `account__owner` so it stays a single valid SQL
  identifier), and the NativeSQLStrategy emits the chained `LEFT JOIN`s. Per-hop
  tenant/RLS read-scope is enforced for EVERY object in the chain — the
  alias-driven scope loop already generalizes, so no security path is rewritten.

  Restricted to **to-one** (lookup / master_detail) relationships, which never fan
  out — aggregates stay correct with no symmetric-aggregate machinery; to-many
  traversal is out of scope. Single-hop datasets are byte-for-byte unchanged (the
  dot-free alias is a no-op for a single segment). Undeclared paths are still
  rejected (ADR-0021 D-C); paths beyond 3 hops are rejected at both parse and
  compile time.

### Patch Changes

- 910a8f0: fix(analytics): compare boolean filters/group-by against the real boolean, not stringified '1'

  The analytics filter normalizer stringified boolean `true` → `'1'`, which the
  ObjectQL strategy then coerced back to the number `1` before calling
  `engine.aggregate`. Boolean fields hold a real `true`/`false`, so `1 !== true`
  never matched: a metric widget filtered on a boolean field (e.g.
  `{ is_critical: true }`) always returned 0, and pie/donut/bar charts grouped by
  a boolean dimension failed to bucket. `stringifyForCube` now serializes booleans
  as the tokens `'true'`/`'false'`, and a new `coerceFilterValueForObjectQL`
  recovers a real boolean for the ObjectQL engine while the SQL path keeps binding
  `1`/`0` (better-sqlite3 cannot bind a JS boolean).

- 715d667: fix(analytics): qualify base-object columns in joined dataset queries

  A dataset that joins a related object (`include` + a `relationship.field`
  dimension/measure) emitted BARE base-table columns in SELECT/GROUP BY while the
  joined columns were alias-qualified. When the base and joined tables share a
  column name (e.g. both have `status`), the query failed at runtime with
  "ambiguous column name". `NativeSQLStrategy` now qualifies plain base-column
  identifiers with the base table when the cube has joins; single-object cubes
  are unchanged (byte-for-byte identical SQL).

## 10.3.0

### Patch Changes

- f73d40a: fix(analytics): log scalar auto-inferred cubes at debug, not warn

  Scalar metric queries (measures only, no `dimensions`/`timeDimensions`) over an
  unregistered cube — the first-class `object-metric` "metric over an object" path
  — auto-infer a trivial count/sum cube by design. That auto-infer now logs at
  `debug` instead of `warn`, so boot/render no longer spams
  `No cube registered for "..."` for a non-problem. Grouped queries (explicit
  dimension / time bucket) over an unregistered cube keep the `warn`, where a
  forgotten cube registration is a real mistake.

### Minor Changes

- 49da36e: feat(analytics): correct analytics over federated objects (ADR-0062 Phase 3, D6)

  Analytics over an external (federated) object now aggregates against the
  **correct** remote table instead of silently querying the wrong one. The
  `NativeSQLStrategy` hand-compiles `FROM "<object>"` and bare column references,
  which bypass the driver's physical-table resolution (`external.remoteName` /
  `remoteSchema` / `columnMap`). It now **declines** any query whose base or joined
  object is federated, routing it to the `ObjectQLStrategy` — whose
  `engine.aggregate()` goes through the driver's `getBuilder` and already honours
  `remoteName`/`remoteSchema` (#2138/#2149). This "reuses the driver's resolution"
  (D6) rather than re-implementing it.

  Adds an optional `StrategyContext.isExternalObject(objectName)` hook (reported by
  the analytics plugin from the object's `external` block). Purely additive — with
  no hook, behavior is unchanged for managed objects.

## 10.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 70609af: Resolve a monetary measure's display currency via the field→tenant chain.

  A dataset measure-currency now resolves through: explicit measure `currency` →
  source-field `currencyConfig.defaultCurrency` → tenant default (`ctx.currency`).
  A measure is monetary iff it declares a currency or aggregates a `currency`-type
  field, so count/avg-of-number measures never receive a code. Wires a
  `measureCurrency` field-metadata resolver from the data engine's object schema.

- 3187952: Dataset analytics enrich **dimension** result fields with their display label (so report/dashboard table headers read "Status" instead of the raw field name) and expose drill-through metadata on the dataset query result: the base `object`, a drillable dimension→field map, and a parallel `drillRawRows` array of each row's raw grouped values (captured before label resolution). This lets a host drill a grouped bucket back to its underlying records with an exact-match filter built from the stored value, not the display label. Date dimensions are excluded (a humanized bucket can't be exact-matched).
- a581385: Propagate a dataset measure's declared currency to the analytics result field.

  Adds an optional `DatasetMeasure.currency` (ISO 4217) on the semantic layer and
  carries it onto each measure result field alongside `label`/`format`, so a
  currency-aware client (Intl symbol) can render `¥1,234` / `$616,000` from a real
  currency code instead of a plain number or a `$` baked into `format`. Additive
  and optional — existing datasets are unaffected.

## 9.10.0

### Patch Changes

- db02bd5: Fix dashboard time-series charts / "last N months" KPIs that filter or group by a `Field.datetime` column silently returning "No rows".

  The analytics `NativeSQLStrategy` compiles dashboard relative-date tokens (`{12_months_ago}`, `{today}`, …) to ISO date strings and binds them directly into raw SQL, bypassing the driver's own filter coercion. Under better-sqlite3 a `Field.datetime` column is stored as an INTEGER epoch (ms), so `assessed_at >= '2025-06-18'` became a TEXT-vs-INTEGER affinity compare that is always false — an empty result even though the rows exist. `Field.date` columns store ISO TEXT and were unaffected.

  The strategy now coerces a temporal comparand to the column's on-disk storage form via a new optional `StrategyContext.coerceTemporalFilterValue` hook, wired to the driver's public `SqlDriver.temporalFilterValue` (the single source of truth for the storage convention). Coercion is dialect-correct: SQLite `Field.datetime` → epoch ms; `Field.date` text and native-timestamp dialects (Postgres/MySQL) are left unchanged, so Postgres is never handed an epoch integer. Applied to `gte`/`lte`/`gt`/`lt`/`equals`, `in`/`notIn`, and the `dateRange`/timeDimension `BETWEEN` path.

- fd07027: fix(analytics): make organization timezone actually drive date-dimension bucketing (ADR-0053 Phase 2, #1982)

  Date-bucketed analytics silently ignored the reference timezone end-to-end. Three independent seams were broken:

  - **service-analytics** — `NativeSQLStrategy` (priority 10) won every cube/dataset query on a SQL driver, but it groups by the raw column (no `date_trunc`) and ignores `timezone`, so a date dimension never bucketed (one row per raw timestamp) and a non-UTC zone was dropped. It now declines queries that carry a `timeDimensions[].granularity`, handing them to `ObjectQLStrategy` → `engine.aggregate` (native bucketing when UTC-safe, uniform in-memory bucketing when non-UTC).
  - **objectql** — the in-memory `count` aggregation treated the `*` count-all sentinel (the Cube `count` measure / a fieldless dataset `count`, both compiled to `sql: '*'`) as a column name, counting non-null of a non-existent property → `0` for every bucket. The driver's `COUNT(*)` masked it; the in-memory path (non-UTC date buckets, `driver-rest`/`driver-memory`) returned zeros. `*` is now counted as all rows.
  - **rest** — `resolveExecCtx` never resolved the localization timezone/locale, so `/analytics/dataset/query` always ran with `timezone: 'UTC'`. It now resolves them through the `settings` service (honouring the 4-tier cascade incl. the `OS_LOCALIZATION_TIMEZONE` env override), mirroring the dispatcher path.

## 9.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 9afeb2d: feat(settings): `localization` settings — platform default timezone, language & formats (ADR-0053 Phase 2)

  Adds a `localization` SettingsManifest, the missing keystone that makes the Phase 2 reference-timezone actually configurable end-to-end. One declaration gives the full settings stack for free: platform built-in default → `global` → `tenant` cascade, a permission-gated settings page, and i18n.

  **Keys** (organization-level; per-user overrides intentionally out of scope for v1): `timezone` (UTC), `locale` (en-US), `default_country`, `date_format`, `time_format`, `number_format`, `first_day_of_week`, `currency` (USD), `fiscal_year_start`. Benchmarked against Salesforce/Workday "Company Information + Locale".

  **Resolver 收编** — `resolveExecutionContext` now resolves `timezone` **and** `locale` from the `localization` settings via the `settings` service (canonical 4-tier cascade), falling back to a direct tenant-scoped `sys_setting` read, then `UTC` / `en-US`. This replaces the hand-rolled `sys_user_preference` + tenant-only `sys_setting` path from #1978 (which bypassed the settings abstraction and is dropped along with the per-user tier). New `ExecutionContext.locale`.

  **Consumer wiring** — analytics date bucketing now picks up the resolved org timezone: `DatasetExecutor` threads `ExecutionContext.timezone` into the query (precedence: explicit selection tz → request tz → UTC), so #1982's tz-aware buckets fire for a configured org without callers passing a zone. Formula `today()`/`datetime` were already wired (#1979/#1980).

  Email `datetime` rendering (`SendTemplateInput.timezone`, shipped in #1981) is intentionally **not** wired here: the only current `sendTemplate` callers are pre-session auth emails with no org context; business-notification callers can pass the zone when they appear.

- 601cc11: feat(analytics): timezone-aware date bucketing (ADR-0053 Phase 2)

  Analytics day/week/month/quarter/year buckets now resolve on a **reference timezone's** calendar days, so a row near a tz day-boundary lands in the bucket a user in that zone would expect — identically on SQLite and Postgres.

  Per ADR-0053 decision **D2**, bucketing is done **in-memory, uniformly** for non-UTC zones rather than emitting dialect-specific `date_trunc … AT TIME ZONE` (SQLite has no tz database and MySQL needs tz tables loaded, so splitting by dialect would shift bucket boundaries for the same data). `engine.aggregate({ timezone })` therefore forces the in-memory aggregation path when a non-UTC reference tz is set — the date-range `where` still goes to the driver, so only matching rows are fetched. **UTC / unset keeps the native driver fast path unchanged.**

  - New shared `calendarPartsInTz` / `calendarPartsInTzOrUtc` util in `@objectstack/core` (DST-safe via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, never hand-rolled offset math; falls back to UTC for an unset/`'UTC'`/invalid zone).
  - `EngineAggregateOptions` and the analytics `executeAggregate` bridge / `ObjectQLStrategy` thread the reference timezone (sourced from the dataset selection / `ExecutionContext`) through to `applyInMemoryAggregation` → `bucketDateValue`, and the draft-preview evaluator's `bucketDate`.
  - `formatDateBucket` (dimension labels) stays UTC-only by design: it re-labels values that were _already_ bucketed upstream, so re-applying a timezone there would shift a correct bucket by a day.

### Minor Changes

- b4765be: Server-side totals for matrix reports (#1753). `queryDataset` selections accept `totals: { groupings: string[][] }` — each grouping a subset of `selection.dimensions` to additionally aggregate by (`[]` = grand total); the marginal rows come back on `AnalyticsResult.totals` in request order. Each subtotal/grand total re-runs the full executor pipeline (measure-scoped filters, derived measures, compareTo) grouped only by that subset, so totals use each measure's true aggregate over the underlying rows — an `avg` total is the average of all rows, never an average of bucket averages (the ADR-0021 line that forbids client-side re-aggregation). Dimension display labels resolve on totals rows the same as the primary grid. A matrix report renderer asks for `{ groupings: [rowDims, columnDims, []] }` and renders the supplied totals row/column.

### Minor Changes

- 4a0736b: Analytics now renders date dimensions as human bucket labels instead of raw
  epoch millis, and buckets them by their declared granularity.

  - A date dimension with an explicit `dateGranularity` is now grouped by that
    bucket (the executor promotes it to a time dimension), so a "monthly" trend
    chart shows one point per month rather than one per raw timestamp.
  - Grouped date values are formatted to a sort-stable label per granularity
    (`year` → `2026`, `quarter` → `2026-Q2`, `month` → `2026-04`, `day`/`week`
    → `2026-04-15`), so charts no longer show `1777632968596`.

  Pairs with the dimension display-label resolution (select option labels / lookup
  names) shipped previously.

- 2c6864f: Analytics dimensions now render human display labels instead of raw stored
  values. A `select` dimension shows its option `label` (e.g. `Backlog` rather than
  `backlog`), and a `lookup`/`master_detail` dimension shows the related record's
  display name (e.g. an account's name rather than its FK id). `queryDataset`
  resolves these server-side, so every dashboard/report chart benefits with no
  frontend change. Date/number/string dimensions are unaffected, and unresolved
  values are left as-is.
- 0bf39f1: `queryDataset` now carries each measure's display `label` and `format` on the
  result `fields`, so presentations can show "Tasks" / "$616,000" instead of the
  raw measure name "task_count" / "616000".

  - `AnalyticsResult.fields[]` gains optional `label?` and `format?`.
  - The dataset executor enriches measure columns from the dataset's measure
    definitions (matching `<name>` and `<name>__compare`).

  The format can't be baked into the numeric row value (charts need the raw
  number), so the renderer applies it at display time.

## [3.2.9] — 2026-03-22

### Added

- Initial implementation of `@objectstack/service-analytics`
- `AnalyticsService` orchestrator implementing `IAnalyticsService`
- Strategy pattern with priority chain:
  - **P1 — NativeSQLStrategy**: Pushes queries as native SQL to SQL-capable drivers (Postgres, MySQL, etc.)
  - **P2 — ObjectQLStrategy**: Translates analytics queries into ObjectQL `engine.aggregate()` calls
  - **P3 — InMemoryStrategy**: Delegates to any registered `IAnalyticsService` (e.g., `MemoryAnalyticsService`)
- `CubeRegistry` for auto-discovery and registration of cubes from manifest definitions and object schema inference
- `AnalyticsServicePlugin` for kernel plugin lifecycle integration
- `queryCapabilities()` driver capability probing for strategy selection
- `generateSql()` dry-run SQL generation across all strategies
- Unit tests covering all strategy branches
