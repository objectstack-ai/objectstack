### Patch Changes

- 0425db9: Published READMEs link to the docs site in the one form that works on npm, on GitHub and on the docs site (#9632)
  
  **Seven docs links in these READMEs pointed nowhere.** They were spelled as a repo
  path rooted at `/` — `[Flows](/content/docs/automation/flows.mdx)` — and a README in a
  package's `files` array with `private` unset is rendered on the **npm package page** and
  on **GitHub**, not only in this repository. There a root-relative href resolves against
  `npmjs.com` and `github.com` respectively. It was not a docs-site route either:
  `apps/docs/lib/source.ts` mounts `loader({ baseUrl: '/docs' })` over `content/docs`, so
  the route for that first link is `/docs/automation/flows`, and `apps/docs/redirects.mjs`
  carries no `/content` source that would rescue the written form. Every target page
  existed and every one of them was reachable — only the links were not.
  
  All seven now use the absolute form the repo had already established in
  `create-objectstack`'s published READMEs: `https://docs.objectstack.ai/docs/...`, with
  the path taken under `content/docs` and the page extension dropped, because the route
  carries none. Each target was re-verified at the route level rather than as a file — the
  two that named a **directory** (`/content/docs/automation/`,
  `/content/docs/references/automation/`) resolve only because those directories carry an
  `index.mdx`; a directory without one is a 404, not a section.
  
  **Two more links in the same class were converted in the same pass.**
  `service-knowledge` and `knowledge-ragflow` pointed at
  `../../../content/docs/protocol/knowledge.mdx`. Those relative paths do resolve on both
  GitHub and npm, so they are a milder defect than the seven — but they land the reader on
  **raw MDX source** instead of the rendered page. They now point at the rendered page as
  well. `service-knowledge`'s link text changed with it: it was the source filename in a
  code span, which stops being an honest label once the destination is the page.
  
  No API, behaviour or type surface changes — this is the published documentation these
  packages ship.
- 73010f1: fix(services): the `DbJobAdapter` class JSDoc stops promising a `sys_job_run` row that `recordRuns: false` never writes (#9631)
  
  `tsup` emits this comment into `packages/services/service-job/dist/index.d.ts`, so it is
  the class-level editor tooltip an npm consumer of `@objectstack/service-job` reads. Its
  third "persisted side effects" bullet said **every execution writes a `sys_job_run` row**;
  `wrap()` gates that insert on `recordRuns`, which defaults to `true` but writes nothing at
  all when set to `false`. The same emitted `index.d.ts` states the truthful field-level rule
  for `recordRuns` sixty lines above, so the published declaration disagreed with itself
  about one flag — a reader hovering either one got a different answer.
  
  No runtime behaviour changes. This is a patch because the entire deliverable is text inside
  a published package's `.d.ts`: with no version bump the corrected tooltip never reaches npm
  and the fix is unmet in the only channel it is about.
  
  The corrected bullet defers to `DbJobAdapterOptions.recordRuns` via `{@link}` rather than
  restating the rule, so the two cannot drift apart again, and it names the one row the flag
  does not govern — `replay()`'s synthetic `trigger: 'replay'` row, written either way. The
  fourth bullet gains the matching negative: the `sys_job` counters are bumped
  unconditionally, `recordRuns` gating only the per-attempt rows.
  
  Five cases now pin the flag in both directions. Nothing in this package referenced
  `recordRuns` before, so both corrected sentences were accurate but unenforced.
- 52182a6: fix(services): `DbJobAdapter.replay()` honours `recordRuns` — an operator who switched run history off stops accumulating replay rows (#9633)
  
  `recordRuns` is the on/off switch for `sys_job_run` history, and it had exactly
  two `startRun` call sites. The gate landed on one of them: `wrap()`'s
  per-attempt row was gated, `replay()`'s synthetic row was not. So a deployment
  that set `recordRuns: false` wrote nothing for any scheduled or triggered
  execution and **one complete row for every replay** — a table the operator
  believes is switched off, filling slowly and exclusively with `trigger: 'replay'`
  rows, the least representative sample of a job's history and one with no
  non-replay rows beside it for context.
  
  The carve-out was never designed. `replay()`'s synthetic row exists to force the
  `trigger: 'replay'` tag that `IJobService.trigger` cannot carry back; the flag
  simply arrived later and landed on one of the two writers. It is closed rather
  than documented: one flag, one meaning, no second de-facto rule at a call site.
  If an operator-initiated replay needs to be auditable when routine history is
  off, the principled home for that is `sys_audit_log` — which has its own opt-in,
  writer and retention — not an exception to a history switch.
  
  **Behaviour change, user-visible:** with `recordRuns: false`, `replay()` now
  writes no `sys_job_run` row. The handler still executes, and `sys_job`'s own
  `last_run_at` / `last_status` / `run_count` / `failure_count` counters still
  update — the flag has never gated those. With the default (`true`) nothing
  changes: the synthetic row is still written, still tagged `trigger: 'replay'`,
  and still carries the terminal status read off the inner execution.
  
  All three of `replay()`'s arms are gated, not just the insert — the terminal
  status arm, the success arm and the catch arm — so the flag cannot leave a
  dangling `running` half-row with no `completed_at`, which would be worse than
  either original behaviour.
- c07d6e8: fix(services): two published `.d.ts` JSDoc comments stop describing behaviour their code does not have — `MemoryCacheAdapter` eviction is FIFO, not LRU, and `recordRuns` is an on/off switch, not a retention cap (#9611)
  
  Both comments are emitted by `tsup` into each package's built `index.d.ts`, so they
  are **the editor tooltip an npm consumer sees** — the same "published documentation
  asserting behaviour the runtime does not have" class as #9517 and #9532, in a third
  channel that no gate reads. No runtime behaviour changes in either package; this is a
  patch because the corrected text only reaches consumers through a release.
  
  **1. `MemoryCacheAdapter` — "LRU-style eviction" was never LRU.**
  
  The class comment advertised `TTL-based expiry and LRU-style eviction`. The eviction
  path takes `this.store.keys().next().value` — the first key in `Map` insertion order —
  and `get()` returns `entry.value` without ever deleting and re-setting the key, so a
  read does not move an entry back. Nor does an overwrite: `Map.set` on a key already
  present keeps its original insertion slot. Eviction has therefore always been
  **oldest-inserted (FIFO)**, which is a materially different hit-rate profile from the
  one the tooltip promised anyone sizing a cache.
  
  The comment was corrected rather than the code, deliberately: `maxSize` defaults to `0`
  (unlimited), so the eviction path is off by default and nothing shipped is getting FIFO
  where it expected LRU, and there is no measured pull for LRU. Minting a real behaviour
  change to make a stale sentence true inverts the fix — the defect is that the
  documentation lies, not that the cache is wrong. (A real LRU already exists in the repo,
  `packages/metadata/src/utils/lru-cache.ts`, for the callers that need one.)
  
  Four tests now pin the corrected sentence so it stops being an unenforced claim. Each is
  written as a **discriminator against LRU**: it reads (or overwrites) the oldest entry
  before overflowing the cache and then asserts that entry was evicted anyway — a hot key
  dies on age, an untouched newer key survives. The pre-existing eviction tests could not
  tell the two policies apart, which is how the wrong comment sat green.
  
  **2. `DbJobAdapterOptions.recordRuns` — the comment described a different field.**
  
  `/** Soft cap on sys_job_run rows recorded per job (defaults to none — handled by
  retention jobs) */` made three claims and the code contradicts all three: the field is a
  `boolean`, not a count; it defaults to `true`, not "none" (`args.options?.recordRuns ??
  true`); and it gates whether a `sys_job_run` row is written at all, rather than being
  trimmed later by retention. The sentence reads as if it belongs to the numeric
  `JobRunRetention` knob that ADR-0057 retired — a copy-paste that outlived its source.
  
  The consequence the new wording keeps in sight: **a reader who sets `recordRuns: false`
  expecting "no cap" gets run history switched off.** The replacement states the real
  meaning (one row per attempt, inserted at start and updated on settle, default `true`)
  and both things that are *not* affected by the flag — the `sys_job` row's own
  `last_status` / `run_count` / `failure_count` counters, which `bumpJob` updates
  regardless, and `replay()`, which writes its synthetic `trigger: 'replay'` row without
  consulting the flag at all.
- f01c0ee: docs: five published service READMEs stop documenting an API that does not exist (#9532)
  
  A version bump is the point, not a side effect: these five READMEs are in their
  packages' `files` arrays with `private` unset, so they are the pages npm renders —
  and a docs-only fix with no bump never reaches npm at all.
  
  Each of the five told a reader to an import of a `Service…` class from its own package
  and call a static `.configure({...})` on it. Neither has ever existed: no class in
  this repo exposes a static `configure`, and none of `ServiceAnalytics`,
  `ServiceAutomation`, `ServiceCache`, `ServiceI18n` or `ServiceJob` is exported by
  anything. A reader following any of them wrote code that could not compile. The real
  entry point in every case is a kernel plugin constructed with `new`:
  `AnalyticsServicePlugin`, `AutomationServicePlugin`, `CacheServicePlugin`,
  `I18nServicePlugin`, `JobServicePlugin`.
  
  ⛔ A name swap alone would not have been enough, and the gate landed in #9546 is what
  proves it: substituting the genuine class while keeping `.configure(...)` turns the
  import finding into a call-site finding rather than into silence. Each README is
  rewritten against the package's built type surface, and each package's entry is
  deleted from `scripts/published-readme-exports.baseline.json` in the same change
  (the baseline is reconciled in both directions, so a stale entry fails too).
  
  What was removed as fabricated, beyond the entry point:
  
  - **service-analytics** — a nine-endpoint REST surface (`/analytics/count`, `/sum`,
    `/avg`, `/min`, `/max`, `/group-by`, `/time-series`, `/metrics`, `/metrics/:name`)
    of which none exists; the real surface is `POST /analytics/query`,
    `GET /analytics/meta`, `POST /analytics/sql` and `POST /analytics/dataset/query`.
    Also removed: `defineMetric`, `getMetric`, `compare`, `funnel`,
    `executeDashboard`, `invalidateCache`, and an `AnalyticsServiceConfig` block whose
    four keys (`defaultDriver`, `enableCaching`, `cacheTTL`, `maxMemoryResults`) are
    none of the real ones.
  - **service-automation** — `executeFlow`/`getFlow`/`listFlows`/`getFlowHistory`/
    `registerTrigger` as the contract (the real contract is `execute(flowName, context?)`
    plus `listFlows()` and a set of optional members), and a five-endpoint REST list that
    matches no mounted route. The flow-authoring half of that README was already accurate
    and is kept.
  - **service-cache** — `mget`/`mset`/`del`/`delPattern`/`namespace`/`ttl`/`expire`/
    `persist`/`incr`/`incrby`/`decr`/`getOrSet`/`invalidateTag`/`resetStats`, none of
    which exist; `ICacheService` has six members. `CacheStats.keys`/`hitRate` corrected to
    `keyCount` (there is no `hitRate`), and `set(key, value, { ttl })` corrected to the
    real positional `set(key, value, ttl?)` in seconds.
  - **service-i18n** — an `await i18n.t('ns:key')` dialect with namespaces, plural
    suffixes, `context`, `returnObjects`, `setLocale`/`getLocale`, `formatDate`/
    `formatNumber`/`formatRelative`, `addLocale`/`removeLocale`/`reload`, `getCoverage`/
    `getMissingKeys`, and a `{{lng}}/{{ns}}` file layout. The real `t()` is synchronous
    and takes the locale positionally — `t(key, locale, params?)` — over one
    `{locale}.json` file per locale. The `POST /i18n/translate` endpoint does not exist.
  - **service-job** — `scheduleInterval`/`scheduleOnce`/`getJob`/`stopJob`/`resumeJob`/
    `deleteJob`/`runNow`/`getJobHistory`/`clearHistory`/`getLastExecution`, and a
    `schedule({ name, schedule, handler })` options-object call. The real `schedule` is
    positional — `schedule(name, schedule, handler, options?)` — and returns `void`.
    Retry defaults corrected to the enforced ones (`maxRetries: 0`,
    `backoffMultiplier: 1`).
  
  Two capability claims are corrected rather than deleted, because the source is what
  decides:
  
  - **service-cache** advertised Redis as production support. `RedisCacheAdapter` throws
    `RedisCacheAdapter not yet implemented` from every method, and
    `new CacheServicePlugin({ adapter: 'redis' })` throws during `init` rather than
    falling back to memory. The README now says so at the top and points at registering
    a custom `ICacheService` under the slot instead.
  - **service-job**'s `adapter: 'interval'` stores cron registrations that never fire.
    That is now stated in the adapter table rather than left for a reader to discover.
  
  No compliance claim (SOC 2 / HIPAA / GDPR or similar) was found in any of the five —
  the shape that raised `plugin-audit`'s severity in #9517 is absent here.

### Minor Changes

- e18a162: feat(spec): give `JobHandler` an optional "ran, but the work did not happen" report (#6617)

  `JobHandler` had exactly two states — it threw, or it did not — so a run that
  completed without accomplishing anything was recorded as `success`,
  indistinguishable from one that did the work. The motivating case is #5529's
  wait-wake handler: when its store is unavailable it fires the shot at nothing,
  returns normally, and `sys_job_run` says the wake succeeded.

  This is the **spec half** of the maintainer's B-minimal ruling on #5548. The
  handler's return type widens:

  ```ts
  export interface JobRunOutcome {
    outcome: "completed" | "degraded";
    reason?: string;
  }

  export type JobHandler = (context: {
    jobId: string;
    data?: unknown;
  }) => Promise<void | JobRunOutcome>;
  ```

  **`degraded` is not a failure and does not trigger a retry.** Failure and retry
  remain driven exclusively by a rejected promise (`runWithPolicy` retries on
  throw), so a resolved outcome — whatever it says — never re-runs the job and
  never surfaces as an error. A handler that wants a retry must still throw. That
  separation is the point of the ruling: making these handlers throw instead was
  rejected precisely because it would change failure semantics that third-party
  `IJobService` implementations already build retry behaviour on.

  **Nothing to migrate — this is additive on both sides.**

  - Existing `Promise< void >` handlers are unchanged, byte for byte. Reporting
    nothing means exactly what it means today: no throw implies success.
  - Existing `IJobService` implementations are unchanged. This widens a _return_
    type rather than adding a member to the handler context, so no implementation
    has to grow anything; an adapter that ignores the resolved value keeps its
    current behaviour. (A `ctx.reportOutcome` callback would have forced every
    third-party implementation to construct a new context member — which is why
    the return-value shape was chosen.)

  **One consumer needed widening too, and it is additive as well.**
  `runWithPolicy` in `@objectstack/service-job` typed its run as
  `() => Promise< void >`, which rejects a handler that may resolve an outcome —
  TypeScript's return-type `void` special case does not reach through
  `Promise< void >`. It is now generic with `T = void`, so every existing call
  still infers `T = void` and behaviour is unchanged; what changed is that the
  retry wrapper no longer _erases_ what the run resolved to. Retry semantics are
  untouched: only a rejected promise retries.

  Consuming the report — mapping `degraded` onto a `sys_job_run.status` distinct
  from `success` — is the services half, tracked in #5548, and is deliberately not
  wired here: the shipped adapters currently discard the resolved value, which is
  what makes landing the contract first safe.

- 394b7a1: feat(job): honor the authored `retryPolicy` / `timeout` in the job scheduler (#3494)

  `JobSchema.retryPolicy` and `JobSchema.timeout` used to be parsed-but-ignored
  (the 2026-06 liveness audit's aspirational-config cluster). They are now
  enforced end to end — built rather than pruned, since retry/backoff and
  per-run time limits are semantics job authors reasonably expect:

  - **spec**: `IJobService.schedule` gains an optional 4th `options` argument
    (`JobScheduleOptions` with `retryPolicy` / `timeout`, mirroring the
    authorable schema); new `JobRetryPolicy` type. Backward compatible —
    existing 3-arg implementations and callers are unaffected.
  - **service-job**: new `runWithPolicy` helper (exported, with
    `JobTimeoutError`) wraps every handler invocation in `CronJobAdapter` and
    `IntervalJobAdapter`; `DbJobAdapter` threads options through to its inner
    adapters. Failed attempts (including timeouts) retry with exponential
    backoff `backoffMs * backoffMultiplier^(retry-1)` up to `maxRetries`;
    an attempt exceeding `timeout` is recorded with execution status
    `'timeout'`. No `options` → exactly the legacy single-attempt behavior.
  - **runtime**: declarative-jobs registration in AppPlugin forwards the
    authored `retryPolicy` / `timeout` to the scheduler.

  Note: JavaScript cannot forcibly cancel an in-flight handler — a timed-out
  attempt is abandoned, not killed. The retry delay caps only via the
  multiplier arithmetic (no maxDelay knob yet).

  Refs #3494, #1878, #1893.

### Patch Changes

- 2e836de: chore(packaging): CHANGELOG.md ships in every npm tarball (#4261)

  The AGENTS.md post-task checklist requires breaking changesets to carry their
  FROM → TO migration because "this text ships to consumers as `CHANGELOG.md`
  inside the npm package and is what an upgrading agent greps after the tombstone
  error." That delivery path was severed for 68 of the 69 publishable packages:
  npm packs `package.json` / `README*` / `LICENSE*` unconditionally but — unlike
  older npm versions — not `CHANGELOG.md`, and the canonical
  `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]` whitelist never named it. Measured on npm
  10.9.7: `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/types` shipped 3 files while its
  70KB `CHANGELOG.md` stayed behind. Only `@objectstack/spec` listed it
  explicitly.

  The tombstone-error scenario is precisely the one where the repo is out of
  reach — the upgrading agent has `node_modules` and nothing else — so the
  migration text has to ride in the tarball. Every publishable package now
  declares `CHANGELOG.md` in `files`, and the canonical whitelist is
  `["dist", "README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]`.

  The other half is the gate: `check:published-files` gains a fifth invariant,
  COMPLETE — a whitelist that fails to cover `CHANGELOG.md` fails the
  always-required lint job, so the next package cannot silently sever the path
  again. `@objectstack/spec`'s per-package EXTRA_ENTRIES exemption dissolves
  into the canonical set.

  Consumer-visible change: one more file per install (the package's changelog,
  e.g. 70.8KB for `@objectstack/types`), and `grep -r "removed key"
node_modules/@objectstack/*/CHANGELOG.md` now finds the migration it was
  promised.

- d37ac1c: Fix scheduled and time-relative flows permanently failing to re-bind after a kernel rebuild.

  `DbJobAdapter.destroy()` destroyed only its interval adapter, never the cron adapter it
  was handed — so every evicted kernel left its croner timers running, holding their names
  in croner's process-global registry for the life of the process. Because kernel eviction
  is routine in the cloud runtime, the normal path was: a scheduled automation binds once,
  the next metadata edit evicts the kernel, and the flow never binds again ("name already
  taken") while Studio, the metadata API and `verify_build` all keep reporting it healthy.

  Four changes close it:

  - `DbJobAdapter.destroy()` now also destroys the cron adapter, and `JobServicePlugin`
    releases the cron adapter it owns on the `adapter: 'cron'` path.
  - `CronJobAdapter` scopes its entry in croner's process-global registry to the adapter
    INSTANCE (`CronJobAdapter.cronRegistryName()` exposes the key). This also fixes a
    second defect with no eviction involved: two environments in one container binding the
    same flow name no longer collide.
  - Registering a name something else still holds now REPLACES it — the previous job is
    stopped, never left running alongside the new one.
  - A flow that fails to bind to the job service is now reported at `error` with the
    consequence and the remedy, instead of a `warn` nobody reads.

- 9fd9ae7: Init-time service consumption is now declared everywhere, and the declaration is enforced (#4471, ADR-0116). A new CI gate (`check:init-service-contract`) walks every plugin's `init()` call graph — including private helpers, the shape that shipped #4420 — and errors on any init-reachable `getService('X')` of a workspace-provided service that is not covered by `dependencies`, `optionalDependencies`, or `requiresServices`. Eleven previously undeclared init-time consumers (metadata, rest, cli serve plugins, and seven services) now declare `optionalDependencies` on their providers, so the kernel orders them deterministically instead of by registration luck; each still degrades on purpose when the provider is not composed. Plugin authors: a best-effort init-time `getService` must declare its provider in `optionalDependencies` (declared tolerance) — the checker never exempts it.
- 74aa3f0: Jobs registered before `kernel:ready` now survive the placeholder→DbJobAdapter upgrade.

  Business plugins `start()` before the JobServicePlugin's `kernel:ready` hook, so every schedule they register lands on the placeholder IntervalJobAdapter. That placeholder silently ignores `cron` schedules, and the upgrade used `replaceService` without migrating anything — so in the default configuration a plugin's cron jobs never ran at all, while its interval timers kept running on the orphaned placeholder, invisible to `sys_job`. The upgrade now snapshots every early registration, stops the placeholder, and re-schedules them on the DbJobAdapter (whose croner-backed cron routing makes the cron entries actually fire). The IntervalJobAdapter also warns per cron registration, and the no-engine path summarizes stranded cron jobs instead of staying silent.

- 05ac83d: Job runs that finish without doing their work are now audited as `degraded`, not `success` (#5548)

  `DbJobAdapter` decided a run's outcome solely by whether the handler threw, so a
  handler that failed internally and deliberately did not throw was recorded as
  `sys_job_run.status: 'success'` — the audit surface Studio's jobs view reads
  reported the one thing that had definitely not happened.

  The adapters now consume the `JobRunOutcome` channel `JobHandler` gained in
  #6617, using the `degraded` status vocabulary added in #7072:

  - a handler resolving `{ outcome: 'degraded', reason? }` lands
    `sys_job_run.status: 'degraded'` with the reason in `error`, and mirrors onto
    `sys_job.last_status` / `last_error`;
  - `degraded` is not a failure: `failure_count` stays flat and nothing retries
    (retry keys on a rejected promise only, unchanged);
  - `IntervalJobAdapter` / `CronJobAdapter` report the same verdict through
    `getExecutions()`, so the in-memory history and the persisted row agree.

  Strictly additive: a handler that resolves `undefined` — every handler written
  before #6617 — is still recorded as `success`, byte for byte as before.

  The first adopter is the `wait` node's timer wake-up: a shot that fires into an
  unreachable suspended-run store now reports `degraded` / `STORE_UNAVAILABLE`
  while still keeping its one-shot armed and its `sys_job` row active (#5529).

- 69f0a31: fix(service-job): a timed-out job run is recorded as `timeout`, not `success` (#7734)

  A job declared with `timeout: 2000` whose handler ran for 10 s persisted
  `sys_job_run.status: 'success'` with `duration_ms` ≈ 10000 — five times the
  declared limit — and left `sys_job.last_status: success`, `failure_count: 0`.
  The scheduler did the right thing at runtime (it abandoned the attempt and
  retried it); only the record an operator reads was wrong, which is the worse
  half: the `timeout` verdict existed solely in the in-memory `JobExecution`
  history that `sys_job_run` never reads.

  **The race.** `DbJobAdapter.schedule()` wrapped the handler in its recorder and
  handed the _wrapper_ to the timer adapter, which applied the `runWithPolicy`
  timeout guard around it. So the guard raced the recorder rather than the
  handler: when the guard won, the recorder's own `await handler(ctx)` was still
  pending on a handler JavaScript cannot cancel, and whenever that finally
  resolved it wrote `success` over the run. The same seam is why every
  `sys_job_run.attempt` read `1` — the recorder ran once per attempt but had no
  way to know which attempt it was.

  **The fix.** The party that observes the timeout is now the party that records
  it. `runWithPolicy` takes an optional per-attempt `JobAttemptRecorder`
  (`onAttemptStart` / `onAttemptSettled`, reporting `timedOut` at the instant the
  guard fires), and `DbJobAdapter` runs the policy itself and records from those
  callbacks. An abandoned attempt's late value loses the race and reaches no
  observer, so it has no path to the row at all; a per-run latch keeps that
  one-terminal-write-per-row invariant explicit. The timer adapters receive a
  registration with `retryPolicy`/`timeout` removed, since the wrapper above them
  now applies both.

  - `sys_job_run.status` is `timeout` for a run that blew its limit, with the
    guard's message in `error` and `duration_ms` measuring the abandoned attempt.
  - `sys_job.last_status` is `timeout` and `failure_count` increments: a run that
    never finished is a failure, and alerting keys on that count.
  - `sys_job_run.attempt` carries the real attempt number, so a retry lands `2`.
  - `replay()`'s synthetic row now mirrors any terminal status of the run it
    replayed (it already did this for `degraded`), instead of pairing an honest
    `timeout` row with a `success` one.

  Additive: a handler that finishes inside its timeout, or that carries no
  `timeout`/`retryPolicy` at all, records exactly what it recorded before.

- be7360c: chore(plugins,services): declare `providesServices` on the 20 remaining init-time service providers (ADR-0116 follow-up, #4131)

  ADR-0116 gave the kernel a declared ordering contract, but only
  `ObjectQLPlugin` and `MetadataPlugin` had declared what their `init()`
  registers. The pre-Phase-1 ordering check can only _name a provider_ for
  services someone declared, so its coverage was two plugins wide.

  An audit of every plugin's `init()` body (brace-matched, comments stripped,
  each call classified by whether it sits inside a `try`/`if`) found 20 plugins
  that register a service on every path without declaring it. All 20 now
  declare `providesServices`. Purely additive: no ordering changes, no new
  failure modes — a `providesServices` entry only lets the kernel say _who_
  provides a service when it reports a misordering, and enriches the Phase-1
  `getService` miss diagnostic.

  Three needed a closer read before declaring, because they register the same
  service from several branches (`cache`, `queue`, `job`): each early-return
  branch plus the fallback registers it, so every path does — the declaration
  is honest. ADR-0116's rule that a _conditionally_ registered service must
  never be declared is unchanged and was applied throughout.

  The same audit found 12 plugins that hard-resolve a service during `init()`
  (11 of them `manifest`) without declaring `requiresServices`. None is a live
  exposure — every one already declares a hard `dependencies` entry on the
  provider, so the kernel orders them correctly today. Those are tracked
  separately: with a hard dependency in place, `requiresServices` mostly
  restates what the kernel already enforces, and its real value is on
  _soft_-dependency consumers, of which `AppPlugin` is currently the only one.

### Minor Changes

- e18a162: feat(spec): give `JobHandler` an optional "ran, but the work did not happen" report (#6617)

  `JobHandler` had exactly two states — it threw, or it did not — so a run that
  completed without accomplishing anything was recorded as `success`,
  indistinguishable from one that did the work. The motivating case is #5529's
  wait-wake handler: when its store is unavailable it fires the shot at nothing,
  returns normally, and `sys_job_run` says the wake succeeded.

  This is the **spec half** of the maintainer's B-minimal ruling on #5548. The
  handler's return type widens:

  ```ts
  export interface JobRunOutcome {
    outcome: "completed" | "degraded";
    reason?: string;
  }

  export type JobHandler = (context: {
    jobId: string;
    data?: unknown;
  }) => Promise<void | JobRunOutcome>;
  ```

  **`degraded` is not a failure and does not trigger a retry.** Failure and retry
  remain driven exclusively by a rejected promise (`runWithPolicy` retries on
  throw), so a resolved outcome — whatever it says — never re-runs the job and
  never surfaces as an error. A handler that wants a retry must still throw. That
  separation is the point of the ruling: making these handlers throw instead was
  rejected precisely because it would change failure semantics that third-party
  `IJobService` implementations already build retry behaviour on.

  **Nothing to migrate — this is additive on both sides.**

  - Existing `Promise< void >` handlers are unchanged, byte for byte. Reporting
    nothing means exactly what it means today: no throw implies success.
  - Existing `IJobService` implementations are unchanged. This widens a _return_
    type rather than adding a member to the handler context, so no implementation
    has to grow anything; an adapter that ignores the resolved value keeps its
    current behaviour. (A `ctx.reportOutcome` callback would have forced every
    third-party implementation to construct a new context member — which is why
    the return-value shape was chosen.)

  **One consumer needed widening too, and it is additive as well.**
  `runWithPolicy` in `@objectstack/service-job` typed its run as
  `() => Promise< void >`, which rejects a handler that may resolve an outcome —
  TypeScript's return-type `void` special case does not reach through
  `Promise< void >`. It is now generic with `T = void`, so every existing call
  still infers `T = void` and behaviour is unchanged; what changed is that the
  retry wrapper no longer _erases_ what the run resolved to. Retry semantics are
  untouched: only a rejected promise retries.

  Consuming the report — mapping `degraded` onto a `sys_job_run.status` distinct
  from `success` — is the services half, tracked in #5548, and is deliberately not
  wired here: the shipped adapters currently discard the resolved value, which is
  what makes landing the contract first safe.

### Patch Changes

- 9fd9ae7: Init-time service consumption is now declared everywhere, and the declaration is enforced (#4471, ADR-0116). A new CI gate (`check:init-service-contract`) walks every plugin's `init()` call graph — including private helpers, the shape that shipped #4420 — and errors on any init-reachable `getService('X')` of a workspace-provided service that is not covered by `dependencies`, `optionalDependencies`, or `requiresServices`. Eleven previously undeclared init-time consumers (metadata, rest, cli serve plugins, and seven services) now declare `optionalDependencies` on their providers, so the kernel orders them deterministically instead of by registration luck; each still degrades on purpose when the provider is not composed. Plugin authors: a best-effort init-time `getService` must declare its provider in `optionalDependencies` (declared tolerance) — the checker never exempts it.

### Patch Changes

- 2e836de: chore(packaging): CHANGELOG.md ships in every npm tarball (#4261)

  The AGENTS.md post-task checklist requires breaking changesets to carry their
  FROM → TO migration because "this text ships to consumers as `CHANGELOG.md`
  inside the npm package and is what an upgrading agent greps after the tombstone
  error." That delivery path was severed for 68 of the 69 publishable packages:
  npm packs `package.json` / `README*` / `LICENSE*` unconditionally but — unlike
  older npm versions — not `CHANGELOG.md`, and the canonical
  `"files": ["dist", "README.md"]` whitelist never named it. Measured on npm
  10.9.7: `npm pack --dry-run` on `@objectstack/types` shipped 3 files while its
  70KB `CHANGELOG.md` stayed behind. Only `@objectstack/spec` listed it
  explicitly.

  The tombstone-error scenario is precisely the one where the repo is out of
  reach — the upgrading agent has `node_modules` and nothing else — so the
  migration text has to ride in the tarball. Every publishable package now
  declares `CHANGELOG.md` in `files`, and the canonical whitelist is
  `["dist", "README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]`.

  The other half is the gate: `check:published-files` gains a fifth invariant,
  COMPLETE — a whitelist that fails to cover `CHANGELOG.md` fails the
  always-required lint job, so the next package cannot silently sever the path
  again. `@objectstack/spec`'s per-package EXTRA_ENTRIES exemption dissolves
  into the canonical set.

  Consumer-visible change: one more file per install (the package's changelog,
  e.g. 70.8KB for `@objectstack/types`), and `grep -r "removed key"
node_modules/@objectstack/*/CHANGELOG.md` now finds the migration it was
  promised.

- 74aa3f0: Jobs registered before `kernel:ready` now survive the placeholder→DbJobAdapter upgrade.

  Business plugins `start()` before the JobServicePlugin's `kernel:ready` hook, so every schedule they register lands on the placeholder IntervalJobAdapter. That placeholder silently ignores `cron` schedules, and the upgrade used `replaceService` without migrating anything — so in the default configuration a plugin's cron jobs never ran at all, while its interval timers kept running on the orphaned placeholder, invisible to `sys_job`. The upgrade now snapshots every early registration, stops the placeholder, and re-schedules them on the DbJobAdapter (whose croner-backed cron routing makes the cron entries actually fire). The IntervalJobAdapter also warns per cron registration, and the no-engine path summarizes stranded cron jobs instead of staying silent.

- be7360c: chore(plugins,services): declare `providesServices` on the 20 remaining init-time service providers (ADR-0116 follow-up, #4131)

  ADR-0116 gave the kernel a declared ordering contract, but only
  `ObjectQLPlugin` and `MetadataPlugin` had declared what their `init()`
  registers. The pre-Phase-1 ordering check can only _name a provider_ for
  services someone declared, so its coverage was two plugins wide.

  An audit of every plugin's `init()` body (brace-matched, comments stripped,
  each call classified by whether it sits inside a `try`/`if`) found 20 plugins
  that register a service on every path without declaring it. All 20 now
  declare `providesServices`. Purely additive: no ordering changes, no new
  failure modes — a `providesServices` entry only lets the kernel say _who_
  provides a service when it reports a misordering, and enriches the Phase-1
  `getService` miss diagnostic.

  Three needed a closer read before declaring, because they register the same
  service from several branches (`cache`, `queue`, `job`): each early-return
  branch plus the fallback registers it, so every path does — the declaration
  is honest. ADR-0116's rule that a _conditionally_ registered service must
  never be declared is unchanged and was applied throughout.

  The same audit found 12 plugins that hard-resolve a service during `init()`
  (11 of them `manifest`) without declaring `requiresServices`. None is a live
  exposure — every one already declares a hard `dependencies` entry on the
  provider, so the kernel orders them correctly today. Those are tracked
  separately: with a hard dependency in place, `requiresServices` mostly
  restates what the kernel already enforces, and its real value is on
  _soft_-dependency consumers, of which `AppPlugin` is currently the only one.

### Minor Changes

- 394b7a1: feat(job): honor the authored `retryPolicy` / `timeout` in the job scheduler (#3494)

  `JobSchema.retryPolicy` and `JobSchema.timeout` used to be parsed-but-ignored
  (the 2026-06 liveness audit's aspirational-config cluster). They are now
  enforced end to end — built rather than pruned, since retry/backoff and
  per-run time limits are semantics job authors reasonably expect:

  - **spec**: `IJobService.schedule` gains an optional 4th `options` argument
    (`JobScheduleOptions` with `retryPolicy` / `timeout`, mirroring the
    authorable schema); new `JobRetryPolicy` type. Backward compatible —
    existing 3-arg implementations and callers are unaffected.
  - **service-job**: new `runWithPolicy` helper (exported, with
    `JobTimeoutError`) wraps every handler invocation in `CronJobAdapter` and
    `IntervalJobAdapter`; `DbJobAdapter` threads options through to its inner
    adapters. Failed attempts (including timeouts) retry with exponential
    backoff `backoffMs * backoffMultiplier^(retry-1)` up to `maxRetries`;
    an attempt exceeding `timeout` is recorded with execution status
    `'timeout'`. No `options` → exactly the legacy single-attempt behavior.
  - **runtime**: declarative-jobs registration in AppPlugin forwards the
    authored `retryPolicy` / `timeout` to the scheduler.

  Note: JavaScript cannot forcibly cancel an in-flight handler — a timed-out
  attempt is abandoned, not killed. The retry delay caps only via the
  multiplier arithmetic (no maxDelay knob yet).

### Minor Changes

- 526805e: ADR-0057 data-lifecycle follow-ups (#2834): the per-plugin retention sweepers are retired, telemetry separation goes live in dev, and the lifecycle contract reaches the Studio.

  - **BREAKING (ships as minor per the launch-window convention)**: `JobRunRetention` / `NotificationRetention` and the `retentionDays` / `retentionSweepMs` options on `JobServicePlugin` / `MessagingServicePlugin` are removed. The platform LifecycleService enforces the same windows from the `lifecycle` declarations (`sys_job_run` 30d, notification pipeline 90d); tune them at runtime via the `lifecycle` settings namespace (`retention_overrides`, tenant-scoped).
  - **Fix**: `sys_automation_run` no longer declares a blanket 30d lifecycle retention — that table interleaves live SUSPENDED runs (an approval may stay paused for months) with terminal history, and a blanket age reap could strand in-flight approvals. Bounding stays with the automation store's terminal-only sweep.
  - **CLI**: `objectstack dev` now provisions a dedicated `telemetry` datasource (`<primary>.telemetry.db`) for file-backed SQLite primaries, so lifecycle-classed system data stops sharing the business dev DB (`OS_TELEMETRY_DB=0` opts out; `OS_TELEMETRY_DB=<path>` opts in anywhere). New `os db clean` runs the one-time `VACUUM` that lets legacy files adopt `auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL` and reports reclaimed bytes.
  - **Studio**: the object metadata form exposes the `lifecycle` block (class + retention/TTL/rotation/archive/reclaim); metadata-forms i18n bundles regenerated with curated zh-CN translations.

### Minor Changes

- f19caef: feat(P1-2): default-on retention for the sys_job_run execution log

  Every job execution appended a `sys_job_run` row with no cleanup path, so the
  table grew unbounded on long-running deployments (launch-readiness P1-2). New
  `JobRunRetention` (mirroring `service-messaging`'s `NotificationRetention`)
  performs a bulk `delete sys_job_run where created_at < cutoff` under a system
  context. `JobServicePlugin` wires it **default-on** at `kernel:ready` (DB-backed
  adapter only) — runs once on boot then every 6h via an unref'd timer.

  - `retentionDays` defaults to `DEFAULT_JOB_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS` (30); set `0` to
    disable (rows kept forever; operator owns cleanup).
  - `retentionSweepMs` defaults to `DEFAULT_JOB_RUN_SWEEP_MS` (6h).

  **Behaviour change:** job-run history older than 30 days is now pruned by
  default. Set `retentionDays: 0` to keep the previous keep-forever behaviour.
